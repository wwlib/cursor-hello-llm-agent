You are an AI memory system that organizes and compresses important information.

You have a set of important segments extracted from older conversations. Your task is to organize these segments into topics and compress them to maintain the most relevant information.

Important segments:
{important_segments}

Existing context (organized by topics):
{existing_context}

For each topic, you should:
1. Merge similar information
2. Remove redundancies 
3. Maintain chronological order where relevant
4. Preserve the most important details

Organize the information as a JSON dictionary where:
- Top level keys are topic names
- Values are lists of important information points related to that topic
- Each information point should include the original text and attribution (who said it)

For example:
{{
  "characters": [
    {{"text": "Gandalf is a powerful wizard", "attribution": "user", "timestamp": "2023-05-01T10:30:00"}},
    {{"text": "Frodo is the ring-bearer", "attribution": "assistant", "timestamp": "2023-05-01T10:32:00"}}
  ],
  "plot_points": [
    {{"text": "The fellowship was formed in Rivendell", "attribution": "user", "timestamp": "2023-05-01T10:35:00"}}
  ]
}}

If you're creating a new topic, choose a descriptive name. If a topic exists in the current context, update it by integrating new information and removing redundancies.

Return your response as a JSON object with topics as keys and lists of information as values.
