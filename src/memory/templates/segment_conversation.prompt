You are a text analysis system. Your task is to segment the provided CONTENT into meaningful phrases, each containing a single idea or piece of information.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Divide the CONTENT into phrases, aka segments.
2. Each segment should encompass one coherent idea, fact, or piece of information
3. Each segment should contain an exact substring of the original text
4. No substring of the CONTENT should appear in more than one segment
5. Avoid creating segments that are too long or that contain multiple separate ideas
6. IMPORTANT: Every part of the original text must be included in exactly one segment
7. Maintain context by keeping related ideas together in the same segment
8. Include all questions, statements, and descriptive text
9. Preserve important modifiers and qualifiers with their related content
10. NEVER duplicate content - each piece of text should appear exactly once
11. For single sentences, return them as a single segment
12. CRITICAL: If the input is a single sentence, return it as a single segment without any duplication

For example, given:
"Captain Sara patrols the eastern border with her squad of ten guards. She's concerned about recent monster sightings and has requested additional resources."

The segmentation would be:
[
  "Captain Sara patrols the eastern border with her squad of ten guards.",
  "She's concerned about recent monster sightings and has requested additional resources."
]

For a single sentence like "This is a single sentence.", the segmentation would be:
[
  "This is a single sentence."
]

IMPORTANT: Never duplicate segments. Each piece of text should appear exactly once in the output.
If the input is a single sentence, return it as a single segment without any duplication.
If no CONTENT is provided, return an empty array.

Return ONLY a JSON array of strings, with each string being a distinct segment. The response should be valid JSON that can be directly parsed. Make sure to include ALL content from the original text in your segmentation.
