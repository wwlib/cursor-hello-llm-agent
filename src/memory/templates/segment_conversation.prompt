You are a text analysis system. Your task is to segment the provided content into meaningful phrases, each containing a single idea or piece of information.

CONTENT:
{content}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Divide the content into distinct segments, each representing one coherent idea, fact, or piece of information
2. Each segment should be a complete phrase or sentence
3. Preserve the original meaning and context
4. Don't omit any significant information
5. Avoid creating segments that are too long or that contain multiple separate ideas

For example, given:
"Captain Sara patrols the eastern border with her squad of ten guards. She's concerned about recent monster sightings and has requested additional resources."

The segmentation would be:
[
  "Captain Sara patrols the eastern border with her squad of ten guards.",
  "She's concerned about recent monster sightings.",
  "She has requested additional resources."
]

Return ONLY a JSON array of strings, with each string being a distinct segment. The response should be valid JSON that can be directly parsed.
