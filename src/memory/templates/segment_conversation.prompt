You are a text processing system. Your task is prepare the provided INPUT_TEXT for inclusion in a semantic search database by segmenting it.

The segments will be added to a semantic search database so each segment should comprise a complete idea with all relevant details, modifiers, qualifiers, etc.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. If the text is long and contains more than one complete idea, please split the INPUT_TEXT into segments
2. IMPORTANT: Keep relevant information and context together in the same segment.
3. It is better to have fewer, longer segments that to create segments with incomplete context.
4. IMPORTANT: Do not enhance or edit the text in any way. Segments must be exact, literal substrings of the imput text.
5. If the text contains only one complete idea, then do not split it and return the INPUT_TEXT as one segment.
6. Return ONLY a JSON array of strings, with each string being a distinct segment. The response should be valid JSON that can be directly parsed.

INPUT_TEXT:
{content}
