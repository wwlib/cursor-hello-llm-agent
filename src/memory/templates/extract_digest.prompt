You are a knowledge extraction system. Your task is to analyze the segmented content and extract structured information into a digest.

SEGMENTED CONTENT:
{segments}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze each segment for distinct information
2. Extract specific facts and relationships
3. Organize the extracted information according to the required JSON structure
4. Include segment indexes in the "segmentIndexes" field to trace facts back to source segments
5. Be selective - focus on extracting only meaningful, non-obvious information
6. Assign importance levels (high/medium/low) based on the significance of the information
7. Provide a brief "context" field explaining the information
8. Specify the "source" as either "user", "assistant", or "inferred"
9. Assign a relevant topic to each fact and relationship

Return ONLY a JSON object with the structure below. The response must be valid JSON that can be directly parsed.
