You are a memory management system. Your task is to analyze the CURRENT_MEMORY_STATE and update the working_memory with any new information.

CURRENT_MEMORY_STATE:
{memory_state}

Instructions:
1. Analyze the CURRENT_MEMORY_STATE, paying special attention to the digest information in the conversation history
2. Use the structured "new_facts" and "new_relationships" from digests to update working memory
3. Consider the "importance" level when deciding what information to retain
4. Add any new entities to working_memory.structured_data.entities
5. Add new facts to working_memory.knowledge_graph.simple_facts
6. Add new relationships to working_memory.knowledge_graph.relationships
7. DO NOT modify static_memory
8. DO NOT modify the schema or structure of existing data
9. DO NOT remove any existing information
10. Return ONLY the updated working_memory section as a valid JSON object

The knowledge_graph should adhere to this schema:
{{
    "simple_facts": [
        {{
            "subject": "subject description or entity_name",
            "fact": "fact about the subject",
            "source": "user|assistant|inferred"
        }}
    ],
    "relationships": [
        {{
            "subject": "subject description or entity_name",
            "predicate": "RELATION_TYPE",
            "object": "object description",
            "source": "user|assistant|inferred"
        }}
    ]
}}

IMPORTANT: Your response must be a valid JSON object containing ONLY the working_memory section. Do not include any other text or explanation. The response should start with {{ and end with }}.

Example response format:
{{
    "working_memory": {{
        "structured_data": {{
            "entities": [
                {{
                    "entity_name": "entity name",
                    "description": "subject description",
                    "type": "subject_type",
                    "features": ["feature1", "feature2"],
                }}
            ]
        }},
        "knowledge_graph": {{
            "simple_facts": [],
            "relationships": []
        }}
    }}
}}

REMEMBER: Your response must be ONLY a JSON object with no additional text, comments, or explanations.
