You are a text preprocessing system. Your task is to analyze the provided INPUT_TEXT and if it is not already in prose form, transform it so that it is in prose form.

The INPUT_TEXT will be plain text which could include markdown, YAML, bulleted lists, paragraphs, headings, or any other textual format describing contextual elements. The focus is on the CONTENT of the text, not the formatting.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Carefully read and understand the provided INPUT_TEXT to identify the key elements, relationships, and concepts within the text.
2. If the INPUT_TEXT is not already in prose form, please transform the INPUT_TEXT into prose.
4. IMPORTANT: Do NOT introduce new information or eitorializeing that is not explicitly in the INPUT_TEXT.
3. Return your output as plain text prose.
4. REMEMBER: If the INPUT_TEXT is already in prose form, please return it as-is.
5. REMEMBER: If the INPUT_TEXT is just a single, prose sentence, please return it as-is.

INPUT_TEXT:
{input_data}
