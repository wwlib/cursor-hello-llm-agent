You are a memory management system. Your task is to answer queries about the current memory state.

Current Memory State:
{memory_state}

User Query:
{query}

IMPORTANT: You must return ONLY a JSON object with this exact structure:
{{
    "response": "Your natural language response here as a single string"
}}

Example valid response:
{{
    "response": "The Lost Valley contains three main settlements: Haven in the center, Riverwatch to the east, and Mountainkeep to the west."
}}

DO NOT include any other fields or structures in your response.
DO NOT return the memory state or any complex objects.
ONLY return the response object with a single string value.
Your response MUST be valid JSON that can be parsed.
