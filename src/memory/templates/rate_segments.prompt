You are an AI memory system that helps organize and prioritize information. Your task is to rate the importance of text segments, assign relevant topics, and classify each segment's type.

The segments below are from a conversation. For each segment:
1. Assign an importance rating from 1-5 (where 5 is extremely important and 1 is not important)
2. Identify relevant topics that the segment relates to
3. Classify the segment as one of:
   - query: A question or request for information
   - information: General information including declarations of facts or opinions
   - action: Information about an action taken by the user, agent, or npc
   - command: Commands invoked by the the user, agent, or npc - i.e. tell me about the world, or accept the quest

Use this IMPORTANCE_SCALE to determine importance:

IMPORTANCE_SCALE
5: Essential Information - essential details about the domain, status, actions, inventory
4: Important Information - important details that will inform decisions
3: Extra Information - non-essential informatino that adds richness
2: Unimportant Information - information that need not be retained
1: Redundant Information - information already in the EXISTING_MEMORY_CONTEXT

EXISTING_MEMORY_CONTEXT:
{static_memory}

{memory_context}

SEGMENTS_TO_RATE:
{segments}

Provide your response as a JSON array of objects with "text", "importance", "topics", and "type" fields:
[
  {{
    "text": "original segment text",
    "importance": number from 1-5,
    "topics": ["topic1", "topic2"],
    "type": "query|information|action|command"
  }},
  ...
]
