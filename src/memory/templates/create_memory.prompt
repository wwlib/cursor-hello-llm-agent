You are a memory management system. Your task is to analyze the provided information and create an initial memory structure that is appropriate for the domain.

Input Data:
{input_data}

{domain_guidance}

Requirements:
1. Return a JSON object with a top-level "static_memory" field
2. static_memory must contain:
   - structured_data: Organize domain entities in a way that makes sense for this use case
   - knowledge_graph: Represent relationships between entities in a way that fits the domain
3. Choose data structures that best represent the domain's needs
4. Use consistent field names and types within your chosen structure
5. Make sure all JSON is properly formatted and closed

The internal structure of structured_data and knowledge_graph should be determined by what makes sense for the domain.
Use the domain guidance provided to inform your choices about:
- What entities and properties to track
- How to represent relationships
- What naming conventions to use
- What data structures will be most useful

Example Response (This is just one possible structure - yours should fit the domain):
{{
    "static_memory": {{
        "structured_data": {{
            // Your domain-appropriate structure here
            // This is just an example:
            "locations": [
                {{
                    "name": "Haven",
                    "type": "settlement",
                    "region": "central",
                    "description": "Main settlement"
                }}
            ],
            "characters": [
                {{
                    "name": "Elena",
                    "role": "mayor",
                    "affiliation": "Haven Council"
                }}
            ]
        }},
        "knowledge_graph": {{
            // Your domain-appropriate structure here
            // This is just an example:
            "leadership": {{
                "Haven": {{
                    "leader": "Elena",
                    "title": "Mayor"
                }}
            }},
            "locations": {{
                "Haven": {{
                    "region": "central",
                    "connected_to": ["Riverwatch", "Mountainkeep"]
                }}
            }}
        }}
    }}
}}
