You are tasked with creating an initial memory structure for an AI agent based on the provided input data.

INPUT DATA:
{input_data}

DOMAIN-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE:
{domain_guidance}

Your goal is to organize the input data into a clear, structured format that will serve as the foundation for the agent's memory. Focus on extracting the core concepts, entities, and relationships from the input data.

Create a memory structure with these components:
1. Static Memory: Essential, unchanging information about the domain

For the static memory, organize information in a way that makes sense for this specific domain. Use a structure that best represents the input data and will be useful for the agent.

Return your response as a JSON object with this structure:
{{
  "static_memory": {{
    // Organize domain knowledge here in a way that makes sense for this domain
    // You can use nested objects, arrays, or any structure that effectively 
    // represents the information
  }}
}}

Be comprehensive but concise. Include all important information from the input data, but organize it in a structured way that will be easy for the agent to access and use.
