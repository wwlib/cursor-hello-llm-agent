You are a memory management system. Your task is to analyze the provided information and create two distinct data structures:

1. structured_data: A catalog of entities (nouns) and their properties
2. knowledge_graph: A collection of relationships (verbs) between entities

Input Data:
{input_data}

{domain_guidance}

Requirements for structured_data:
- Store facts and properties about entities
- Organize entities in a way that makes sense for the domain
- Include all relevant attributes and metadata

Requirements for knowledge_graph:
- Store relationships between entities
- Use clear and consistent relationship types
- Capture important connections and dependencies

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY a valid JSON object with a structure like this. The structure can be agumented as needed:
{{
    "structured_data": {{
        "entities": [
            {{
                "identifier": "entity_id",
                "type": "entity_type",
                "name": "Entity Name",
                "features": ["feature1", "feature2"],
                "description": "Entity description"
            }}
        ]
    }},
    "knowledge_graph": {{
        "relationships": [
            {{
                "subjectIdentifier": "entity_id",
                "predicate": "RELATION_TYPE",
                "objectIdentifier": "other_entity_id"
            }}
        ]
    }}
}}
