You are tasked with creating an initial memory structure for an AI agent based on the provided initial INPUT_DATA.

INPUT_DATA:
{input_data}

DOMAIN_SPECIFIC_GUIDANCE:
{domain_guidance}

Your goal is to organize the initial INPUT_DATA into segments, rate their importance, and arrange them by topic. This will form the foundation for the agent's memory system.

Follow these steps:
1. Break the input data into meaningful segments (discrete pieces of information)
2. Rate each segment's importance on a scale of 1-5 (where 5 is most important)
3. Assign relevant topics to each segment
4. Organize these segments by topic
5. This initial INPUT_DATA will serve as the static (unchanging) grounding for the conversation

The static_memory should include all of the information in the initial INPUT_DATA, segmented and annotated with ratings, topics, etc.

Return your response as a JSON object with this structure:
{{
  "static_memory": {{
    "topics": {{
      "topic_name": [
        {{
          "text": "Original segment text",
          "importance": number from 1-5,
          "source": "initial_data"
        }},
        // Additional segments for this topic...
      ],
      // Additional topics...
    }}
  }}
}}

Be comprehensive in capturing all important information but focus on quality over quantity. Include all essential information from the input data, organized in a way that will be easy for the agent to access and use.
