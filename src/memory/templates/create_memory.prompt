You are a memory management system. Your task is to analyze the provided information and create an initial memory structure that is appropriate for the domain.

IMPORTANT: Assume you are in JSON protocol mode and only respond in strict, parsable JSON including the response to this interaction. If there is anything in the response that is not parsable JSON, the interaction will fail.

Input Data:
{input_data}

{domain_guidance}

Requirements:
1. Return a JSON object with a top-level "static_memory" and "working_memory" fields
2. static_memory must contain:
   - structured_data: Organize domain-specific data in a way that makes sense for this use case
   - knowledge_graph: Represent relationships between entities in a way that fits the domain
3. working_memory must have the same structure as static_memory but start empty
4. Choose data structures that best represent the domain's needs
5. Use consistent field names and types within your chosen structure
6. Make sure all JSON is properly formatted and closed

The internal structure of structured_data should be determined by what makes sense for the domain.
Use the domain guidance provided to inform your choices about how best to structure the input data.

The knowledge_graph should adhere to this schema:
{{
    "simple_facts": [
        {{
            "key": "fact_key",
            "value": "fact_value",
            "context": "fact_context"
        }}
    ],
    "relationships": [
        {{
            "subject": "entity_id",
            "predicate": "RELATION_TYPE",
            "object": "other_entity_id",
            "context": "relationship_context"
        }}
    ]
}}

IMPORTANT: The data returned should look like this:
{{
    "static_memory": {{
        "structured_data": {{
            // Update with new information
            // Use whatever schema makes sense for the domain
        }},
        "knowledge_graph": {{
            "simple_facts": [],
            "relationships": []
        }}
    }},
    "working_memory": {{
        "structured_data": {{
            "entities": []
        }},
        "knowledge_graph": {{
            "simple_facts": [],
            "relationships": []
        }}
    }},
    "metadata": {{
        "created_at": "",
        "last_updated": "",
        "version": "1.0"
    }}
}}

REMEMBER: Assume you are in JSON protocol mode and only respond in strict, parsable JSON including the response to this interaction. If there is anything in the response that is not parsable JSON, the interaction will fail.
