# graph-memory-notes-lisp

(from conversation with GROK)   

I like the suggestion about creating a DSL for generating prompts, and I am very interested in using knowledge graphs with LLMs to provide persistent memory, maybe to supplement/improve RAG techniques. Generating prompts using knowledge graph memory for an experimental agent would be ideal.

I'm thrilled you're excited about creating a DSL for generating prompts and integrating knowledge graphs with LLMs for persistent memory! Combining LISP's strengths in symbolic manipulation with your goal of enhancing LLM performance via knowledge graphs is a fantastic project. This response will outline a practical approach to building a LISP-based DSL for generating LLM prompts, leveraging knowledge graphs to provide persistent memory for an experimental agent, potentially improving on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. I'll tailor the solution to your background in Python, C#, and TypeScript, and your interest in a hobby project that integrates LISP with these languages.
Project Overview: LISP-Based DSL for LLM Prompts with Knowledge Graph Memory
Goal: Create a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) in Common Lisp (or Racket) to generate structured prompts for an LLM, using a knowledge graph to store and retrieve persistent memory (facts, relationships, or context) for an experimental agent. The knowledge graph will enhance RAG by providing structured, queryable memory that persists across interactions, enabling more coherent and context-aware responses.
Why LISP?
Homoiconicity: LISP’s code-as-data paradigm makes it ideal for designing a DSL to generate and manipulate prompt templates.

Symbolic Manipulation: Perfect for building and querying knowledge graphs, which are inherently symbolic (nodes and edges as lists).

Interactive REPL: Allows rapid prototyping and experimentation with prompt generation and graph queries.

Integration:
Use LISP for the DSL and knowledge graph logic.

Integrate with Python for LLM inference (e.g., via Hugging Face or OpenAI APIs) or TypeScript for a web-based interface to interact with the agent.

1) Setting Up LISP on Your MacBook Pro for This Project
Since you liked the previous suggestions, let’s refine the setup for this specific project using SBCL (Common Lisp) for its performance and library ecosystem, with an option for Racket if you prefer its modern tooling.
Installation Recap (SBCL on macOS)
Install Homebrew (if not already done):
bash

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

Install SBCL:
bash

brew install sbcl

Install Quicklisp (for libraries):
bash

curl -O https://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp
sbcl --load quicklisp.lisp

In the SBCL REPL:
lisp

(quicklisp-quickstart:install)
(ql:add-to-init-file)

Editor Setup:
VS Code with Alive: Install the “Alive” extension for Common Lisp. Configure it to use SBCL (set sbcl as the Lisp binary in extension settings).

Emacs with SLIME: If you prefer a traditional LISP environment, install Emacs (brew install emacs) and SLIME via MELPA:
emacs-lisp

M-x package-install RET slime
(setq inferior-lisp-program "sbcl")

Start SLIME: M-x slime.

Libraries:
Install these via Quicklisp for the project:
hunchentoot: Web server for API integration.

cl-ppcre: Regular expressions for prompt manipulation.

s-graph: A simple graph library for knowledge graph implementation (or roll your own, as graphs are natural in LISP).

lisp

(ql:quickload '("hunchentoot" "cl-ppcre" "s-graph"))

Alternative: Racket
If you prefer Racket’s modern ecosystem:
Install: brew install racket

Use DrRacket IDE or racket in the terminal.

Install graph libraries: raco pkg install graph

Racket’s web-server package can replace hunchentoot.

2) Designing the LISP-Based DSL and Knowledge Graph
DSL for Prompt Generation
The DSL will allow you to define reusable prompt templates for an LLM, incorporating dynamic context from a knowledge graph. For example, the DSL could generate prompts like:
“Given the user’s interest in [topic from knowledge graph], provide a detailed explanation of [related concept].”

“Summarize the relationship between [entity A] and [entity B] based on prior interactions.”

DSL Features:
Templates: Define prompt structures with placeholders for knowledge graph data.

Macros: Use LISP macros to simplify prompt generation and embed graph queries.

Flexibility: Support variations in tone, length, or context based on graph-derived insights.

Example DSL Syntax (in Common Lisp):
lisp

(defmacro defprompt (name parameters &body body)
  `(defun ,name ,parameters
     (format nil ,@body)))

(defprompt user-interest-prompt (topic related-concept)
  "Given the user's interest in ~a, provide a detailed explanation of ~a."
  topic related-concept)

Calling (user-interest-prompt "AI" "neural networks") generates:

"Given the user's interest in AI, provide a detailed explanation of neural networks."

Knowledge Graph for Persistent Memory
The knowledge graph will store:
Nodes: Entities (e.g., topics, users, concepts) with attributes (e.g., name, type).

Edges: Relationships (e.g., “user interested in topic,” “topic related to concept”).

Metadata: Timestamps, confidence scores, or context from prior LLM interactions.

Why a Knowledge Graph?
Unlike RAG’s vector-based retrieval, a knowledge graph provides structured, explicit relationships, improving context precision.

Persistent memory: Store user interactions or LLM outputs as graph updates, enabling the agent to “remember” across sessions.

Queryable: Use LISP to query the graph for relevant context to inject into prompts.

Implementation:
Use a simple graph structure in LISP (lists or a library like s-graph).

Store the graph in memory or persist it to a file (e.g., JSON or SQLite via cl-sqlite).

Query the graph to retrieve relevant nodes/edges for prompt generation.

Example Knowledge Graph (simplified):
lisp

(defvar *knowledge-graph* '())

(defun add-node (id type attributes)
  (push (list :id id :type type :attributes attributes) *knowledge-graph*))

(defun add-edge (from-id to-id relationship)
  (push (list :from from-id :to to-id :relationship relationship) *knowledge-graph*))

(defun find-related (id relationship)
  (mapcar #'(lambda (edge) (getf edge :to))
          (remove-if-not #'(lambda (edge) (and (equal (getf edge :from) id)
                                               (equal (getf edge :relationship) relationship)))
                         *knowledge-graph*)))

;; Example usage
(add-node "user1" :user '(:name "Alice"))
(add-node "ai" :topic '(:name "Artificial Intelligence"))
(add-edge "user1" "ai" :interested-in)
(find-related "user1" :interested-in) ; => ("ai")

Combining DSL and Knowledge Graph
The DSL queries the knowledge graph to inject relevant context into prompts. Example:
lisp

(defun generate-contextual-prompt (user-id)
  (let ((interests (find-related user-id :interested-in)))
    (if interests
        (user-interest-prompt (first interests) "related concepts")
        "Tell me about AI in general.")))

(generate-contextual-prompt "user1")
;; => "Given the user's interest in ai, provide a detailed explanation of related concepts."

3) Integrating with Python or TypeScript
To make this practical, integrate the LISP system with Python (for LLM inference) or TypeScript (for a web interface).
Python Integration (LLM Inference)
Goal: Use Python to call an LLM API (e.g., Hugging Face, OpenAI) with prompts generated by LISP.

Approach:
LISP API: Run a web server in LISP using hunchentoot to expose an endpoint for prompt generation.
lisp

(ql:quickload "hunchentoot")
(hunchentoot:define-easy-handler (generate-prompt :uri "/prompt") (user-id)
  (setf (hunchentoot:content-type*) "application/json")
  (format nil "{\"prompt\": \"~a\"}" (generate-contextual-prompt user-id)))
(hunchentoot:start (make-instance 'hunchentoot:easy-acceptor :port 4242))

Python Client: Call the LISP API and pass the prompt to an LLM.
python

import requests
from transformers import pipeline  # Example: Hugging Face

# Get prompt from LISP
response = requests.get("http://localhost:4242/prompt?user-id=user1")
prompt = response.json()["prompt"]

# Call LLM
llm = pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt2")  # Replace with your model
result = llm(prompt, max_length=100)
print(result[0]["generated_text"])

Feedback Loop: Send LLM outputs back to LISP to update the knowledge graph (e.g., new entities or relationships).
lisp

(hunchentoot:define-easy-handler (update-graph :uri "/update") (user-id new-topic)
  (add-node new-topic :topic `(:name ,new-topic))
  (add-edge user-id new-topic :interested-in)
  "{\"status\": \"updated\"}")

TypeScript Integration (Web Interface)
Goal: Create a web interface to interact with the agent, displaying prompts and LLM responses.

Approach:
LISP Backend: Use the same hunchentoot server to serve prompts and graph data.

TypeScript Frontend: Build a React app to send user inputs and display results.
typescript

import React, { useState } from "react";

function App() {
  const [userId, setUserId] = useState("user1");
  const [prompt, setPrompt] = useState("");

  const fetchPrompt = async () => {
    const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:4242/prompt?user-id=${userId}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    setPrompt(data.prompt);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input value={userId} onChange={(e) => setUserId(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={fetchPrompt}>Generate Prompt</button>
      <p>{prompt}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

Enhance with Graph Visualization: Use a library like vis.js in TypeScript to visualize the knowledge graph, querying the LISP backend for nodes and edges.

Improving RAG
RAG Limitations: RAG relies on vector similarity, which can miss structured relationships or long-term context.

Knowledge Graph Advantage:
Persistent memory: Store user interactions as graph updates (e.g., new nodes for topics discussed).

Precise retrieval: Query specific relationships (e.g., “user1’s interests”) instead of relying on embeddings.

Dynamic prompts: Use graph queries to tailor prompts, e.g., “Based on user1’s interest in AI and prior discussion of neural networks, explain deep learning.”

Implementation:
Store LLM outputs in the graph (e.g., add edges for discussed topics).

Query the graph before generating prompts to include relevant context.

Example: If the graph shows user1 -> interested-in -> AI -> related-to -> neural-networks, generate a prompt like:
lisp

(defprompt contextual-deep-prompt (user-id)
  (let ((interests (find-related user-id :interested-in))
        (related (find-related (first interests) :related-to)))
    (format nil "Based on ~a's interest in ~a and prior discussion of ~a, explain deep learning."
            user-id (first interests) (first related))))

4) Sample Workflow for the Experimental Agent
User Interaction:
User inputs their ID and a query via a TypeScript web interface or Python script.

LISP Processing:
The DSL queries the knowledge graph to retrieve relevant context (e.g., user interests).

Generates a tailored prompt using the DSL.

LLM Call:
Python sends the prompt to an LLM API and retrieves the response.

Graph Update:
LISP updates the knowledge graph with new entities or relationships from the LLM response.

Feedback:
The TypeScript frontend displays the response and optionally visualizes the updated graph.

Example:
Graph: user1 -> interested-in -> AI, AI -> related-to -> neural-networks.

Prompt: (contextual-deep-prompt "user1") → “Based on user1’s interest in AI and prior discussion of neural-networks, explain deep learning.”

LLM Response: “Deep learning is a subset of AI that uses neural networks with multiple layers to…” (via Python).

Graph Update: Add deep-learning node and AI -> related-to -> deep-learning edge.

5) Getting Started
Step-by-Step Plan
Setup:
Install SBCL and Quicklisp as described.

Set up VS Code with Alive or Emacs with SLIME.

Add functions to add/query nodes and edges.

Integrate:
Set up a hunchentoot server to expose the DSL and graph.

Write a Python script to call an LLM API with generated prompts.

Optionally, create a TypeScript/React app for a web interface.

  "Given ~a's interest in ~a, explain a related concept in detail."
  user-id topic)

(defun generate-agent-prompt (user-id)
  (let ((interests (find-related user-id :interested-in)))
    (if interests
        (contextual-prompt user-id (first interests))
