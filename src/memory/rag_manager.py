"""RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Manager for enhanced memory retrieval.

This module implements RAG capabilities to improve the LLM-driven Agent's memory access
and response generation. RAG combines the power of semantic search with LLM generation
to provide more accurate, contextually relevant responses.

Key Features:
1. Semantic Search Integration
   - Uses embeddings to find relevant conversation history entries
   - Supports both full-text and segment-level search
   - Enables finding related information across different conversations

2. Context Enhancement
   - Retrieves relevant historical context for current queries
   - Combines static memory with dynamic conversation history
   - Provides better continuity across multiple interactions

3. Memory Augmentation
   - Enhances LLM responses with retrieved context
   - Maintains conversation coherence
   - Reduces hallucination by grounding responses in actual history

Implementation Strategy:

1. Memory Indexing
   - Index both static memory and conversation history
   - Generate embeddings for:
     * Full conversation entries
     * Individual segments from digests
     * Topics and key concepts
   - Maintain separate indices for different types of content

2. Retrieval Process
   - Convert user query to embedding
   - Search across all indices for relevant content
   - Rank results by relevance and recency
   - Apply importance filtering
   - Return top-k most relevant entries

3. Context Assembly
   - Combine retrieved content with current context
   - Format for optimal LLM consumption
   - Maintain source attribution
   - Handle overlapping/redundant information

4. Response Generation
   - Use retrieved context to enhance LLM prompts
   - Ensure responses are grounded in actual history
   - Maintain conversation flow and coherence
   - Track which retrieved content influenced the response

5. Performance Optimization
   - Implement caching for frequent queries
   - Use batch processing for embedding generation
   - Maintain efficient index structures
   - Support incremental updates

Integration Points:

1. MemoryManager Integration
   - Hook into memory update process
   - Index new content as it's added
   - Maintain consistency with memory compression
   - Support memory reconstruction from indices

2. LLM Service Integration
   - Enhance prompts with retrieved context
   - Track which retrieved content influenced responses
   - Support different retrieval strategies for different types of queries

3. Conversation History Integration
   - Index new conversation entries
   - Support temporal queries (e.g., "what did we discuss last week?")
   - Enable finding related conversations

4. Domain-Specific Customization
   - Support domain-specific retrieval strategies
   - Allow custom importance weighting
   - Enable specialized indexing for domain concepts

Usage Example:
```python
# Initialize RAG Manager
rag_manager = RAGManager(
    embeddings_manager=embeddings_manager,
    llm_service=llm_service,
    memory_manager=memory_manager
)

# Query with RAG enhancement
response = rag_manager.query(
    query="What did we discuss about the mountain troll?",
    context={
        "importance_threshold": 3,
        "max_results": 5,
        "include_static_memory": True
    }
)
```

Future Enhancements:
1. Multi-hop Retrieval
   - Chain multiple retrieval steps
   - Follow references between related content
   - Build knowledge graphs from retrieved content

2. Active Learning
   - Track which retrieved content was useful
   - Improve retrieval based on feedback
   - Adapt to user's information needs

3. Temporal Reasoning
   - Track how information evolves over time
   - Handle conflicting or outdated information
   - Support temporal queries

4. Cross-Conversation Analysis
   - Identify patterns across conversations
   - Build topic hierarchies
   - Support meta-level queries about conversation history
