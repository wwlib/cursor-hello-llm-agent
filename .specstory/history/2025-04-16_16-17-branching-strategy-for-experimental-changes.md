# Branching Strategy for Experimental Changes (2025-04-16 12:17:49)

_**User**_

I am working on a branch that is not, yet, merged with main. I am about make some significant changes that may be great, but may also be a dead end. Should I make a new branch based off of the current one?

Yes, creating a new branch based off your current branch is a good practice in this situation. This will give you a safe space to experiment with significant changes while preserving your current work.

Let me check your current branches and help you create a new one.

---

```bash
git branch | cat
```

```
(base) andrewrapo@MacBookPro cursor-hello-llm-agent % git branch | cat
* feature/update-memory-manager
  main
(base) andrewrapo@MacBookPro cursor-hello-llm-agent %
```

---

I can see you're currently on the `feature/update-memory-manager` branch and considering making significant changes. Let's create a new branch based on your current branch:

---

```bash
git checkout -b feature/update-memory-manager-experimental
```

```
(base) andrewrapo@MacBookPro cursor-hello-llm-agent % git checkout -b feature/update-memory-manager-experime
ntal                                                  git checkout -b feature/update-memory-manager-experime
ntal
Switched to a new branch 'feature/update-memory-manager-experimental'
(base) andrewrapo@MacBookPro cursor-hello-llm-agent %
```

---

Perfect! You now have a new branch called `feature/update-memory-manager-experimental` that's based on your current `feature/update-memory-manager` branch. 

This approach gives you several benefits:
- You can freely experiment with your significant changes without risking your current work
- If your changes work out well, you can merge them back to your feature branch
- If they don't work out, you can simply discard this experimental branch and continue with your original branch
- Your original branch remains in a known good state

To switch back to your original branch at any time:
```
git checkout feature/update-memory-manager
```
