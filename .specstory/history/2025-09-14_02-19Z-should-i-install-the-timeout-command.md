I'll help you determine if you need the `timeout` command on your Mac and how to install it if needed.

Let me also check if your project uses the `timeout` command anywhere to help determine if you need it:

Based on my analysis, **yes, you should install the `timeout` command on your Mac**. Here's why and how:

## Why you need it:

Looking at your codebase, I can see that you're actively using the `timeout` command in your development workflow, particularly in your testing and documentation. The grep results show multiple instances where you've tried to use `timeout` commands like:

- `timeout 30s python test_non_blocking_graph_processing.py`
- `timeout 180s python test_non_blocking...`
- `timeout 15 python test_memory_manager_...`

And you've encountered the error: `/bin/bash: timeout: command not found` multiple times in your logs.

## How to install it:

The easiest and most reliable method is using **Homebrew**:

### 1. Install Homebrew (if you don't have it):
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### 2. Install the coreutils package (which includes timeout):
```bash
brew install coreutils
```

### 3. Create a symlink so you can use `timeout` without the 'g' prefix:
```bash
sudo ln -s /opt/homebrew/bin/gtimeout /usr/local/bin/timeout
```

Note: On Apple Silicon Macs, Homebrew installs to `/opt/homebrew/bin/`, while on Intel Macs it's `/usr/local/bin/`. You can check which one you have by running:
```bash
which gtimeout
```

### Alternative (simpler) approach:
You can also add the Homebrew coreutils to your PATH by adding this to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`:
```bash
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"
```

Then reload your shell:
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

This approach makes all GNU coreutils (including `timeout`) available without the 'g' prefix.

## Verification:
After installation, test it:
```bash
timeout 5s echo "This should work now"
```

Given that your project clearly needs the `timeout` command for testing and development workflows, installing it will resolve the "command not found" errors you've been encountering and allow your scripts to work as intended.
