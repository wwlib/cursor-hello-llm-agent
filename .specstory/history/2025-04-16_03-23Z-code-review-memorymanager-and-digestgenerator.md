# Code Review: MemoryManager and DigestGenerator (2025-04-16 03:23Z)

_**User (2025-04-16 03:25Z)**_

Please take a fresh look at the code - especially the MemoryManager and the DigestManager  - and provide a detailed description of them.

---

_**Agent (mode Agent)**_

I'll analyze the `MemoryManager` and `DigestGenerator` components:

## MemoryManager (src/memory/memory_manager.py)

The `MemoryManager` is a sophisticated LLM-driven memory system that manages structured information for an agent:

- **Purpose**: Maintains a persistent, structured memory store for an agent, with both static (unchanging) and working (dynamic) memory sections.

- **Key Components**:
  - Memory structure with `static_memory`, `working_memory`, `metadata`, and `conversation_history`
  - Uses a domain-specific configuration to guide memory organization
  - Persistent storage in JSON format
  - Unique GUID for each memory instance

- **Core Operations**:
  - `create_initial_memory()`: Structures input data into formatted memory using the LLM
  - `query_memory()`: Retrieves information based on user queries
  - `update_memory()`: Updates working memory with newly learned information

- **Memory Organization**:
  - `static_memory`: Foundational knowledge that doesn't change
  - `working_memory`: Dynamic information learned during interactions
  - Both contain `structured_data` and `knowledge_graph` sections
  - Knowledge graph stores both simple facts and structured relationships (subject-predicate-object)

## DigestGenerator (src/memory/digest_generator.py)

The `DigestGenerator` processes conversation entries to extract structured information:

- **Purpose**: Transforms raw conversation content into structured, machine-usable facts and relationships.

- **Two-Step Process**:
  1. **Segmentation**: Breaks conversation content into meaningful chunks
  2. **Information Extraction**: Derives structured facts and relationships from segments

- **Output Structure**:
  - Maintains connection to original conversation via entry GUIDs
  - Organizes extracted information into `new_facts` and `new_relationships`
  - Preserves segmented content for context
  - Provides summary context

The system uses LLM prompting for both memory management and information extraction, with templates loaded from external files. This approach allows the memory structure to adapt to different domains while maintaining a consistent top-level organization.

_**User (2025-04-16 03:30Z)**_

Great. The DigestManager is doing what it is supposed to do, but even when it provides prioritized, structured data to the MemoryManager, the update_memory process does not make use of it and also loses the data that it has accumulated. I am starting to think that having the LLM manage structured data is not a win.

---

_**Agent (mode Agent)**_

You've identified a critical issue. Looking at the code more carefully:

The `update_memory` method in `MemoryManager` doesn't actually use the digests from `DigestGenerator`. Instead, it:

1. Takes the entire memory state (including conversation history)
2. Sends it to the LLM with an update prompt template
3. Replaces the entire working memory with whatever the LLM returns
4. **Clears the conversation history** after update

The main problems are:

1. **Digest data is ignored**: Despite the `DigestGenerator` doing careful extraction and segmentation, the `update_memory` method doesn't use this structured data.

2. **Information loss**: Clearing conversation history after each update means you lose context and the ability to trace how information was derived.

3. **Lack of incremental updates**: Instead of building on previous structured data, it regenerates everything from scratch each time.

This pattern creates several issues:

- **Inconsistency**: The LLM may structure data differently each time
- **Hallucination risk**: Without building on verified structured data, the LLM might introduce errors
- **Poor traceability**: Can't track which conversation led to which memory updates

You're right that having the LLM manage structured data this way is problematic. A more effective approach would:

1. Use the pre-extracted digests to update memory incrementally
2. Maintain conversation references rather than clearing history
3. Have more deterministic update logic with LLM assistance only for specific transformations

---

_**User (2025-04-16 03:38Z)**_

Right. The LLM just ignores most of the digest data in the conversation history.

I want the LLM to manage the memory as much as possible because the goal is for the agent to support many use cases and let the LLM decide the best way to remember important info - without being prescriptive in a use-case-specific way. Acting as a D&D dungeon master is just on case.

---

_**Agent (mode Agent)**_

I see your vision - using the LLM for flexible, domain-adaptive memory management is powerful for handling diverse use cases like D&D and beyond.

The key issue is that while the `DigestGenerator` is creating useful structured data, the `MemoryManager.update_memory()` method isn't leveraging it effectively. The LLM is essentially starting from scratch each time rather than building on the digests.

To fix this while maintaining LLM-driven memory:

1. **Modify the update prompt template** to explicitly focus the LLM on the digests:
   - Highlight the digest data in the prompt
   - Ask the LLM to explicitly review and incorporate the digests into memory
   - Provide clear instructions about maintaining consistent structure

2. **Don't clear conversation history** after updates:
   - Instead, mark conversations as "processed" but keep them
   - This maintains traceability and context

3. **Add an intermediate step** that extracts and presents digests to the LLM:
   - Pre-process the conversation history to surface the most relevant digests
   - Present this as a summary to the LLM alongside the full memory state

4. **Implement versioning** for memory updates:
   - Keep track of how the memory evolves over time
   - Allow rollbacks if needed

This approach keeps the LLM in control of memory structure while providing more guidance about using the digest data effectively, ensuring important information isn't lost between updates.

---

_**User (2025-04-16 03:44Z)**_

A simpler approach - i.e. the SimpleMemoryManager - is to keep the whole conversation history and let it grow continually. the actually works well, but the history will eventually bo too big and will liekly contain lots of redundant, irrelevant data. There needs to be a update/compression step that keeps the memory from getting too big. I wonder if using simpler text rather than strucured JSON woudl be more LLM friendly.

---

_**Agent (mode Agent)**_

You've hit on a key challenge with agent memory systems. Looking at the `SimpleMemoryManager`, it has advantages in simplicity and completeness but will face scaling issues.

For better memory management while keeping the LLM in control:

1. **Periodic summarization** rather than structured extraction:
   - Instead of parsing into strict facts/relationships JSON
   - Have the LLM generate concise text summaries of important information
   - Keep these summaries in chronological order or by topic

2. **Two-tier memory approach**:
   - Recent conversations stay in full form (last N exchanges)
   - Older conversations get compressed into summary text
   - The LLM can reference both when needed

3. **Topic-based organization**:
   - Group related information by topics/themes
   - Let the LLM decide what topics are relevant
   - Update summaries per topic rather than the entire memory

4. **Text-based format instead of rigid JSON**:
   - Use more natural text representations with light structure
   - Maybe Markdown format with headers for topics
   - This is more aligned with how LLMs process information

5. **Relevance scoring**:
   - Have the LLM assign importance to information
   - Gradually fade out less relevant information

The key insight is that heavy JSON structure might be fighting against the LLM's strengths. A more fluid text-based approach with lightweight organization could better leverage how LLMs naturally process information while still providing the necessary compression over time.

---

_**User (2025-04-16 03:50Z)**_

The LLM seems very good at segmenting text into chinks of ideas. Maybe the DigestGenerator should keep only the importan segments - as text - and use the prioritized segments in the conversation history.

---

_**Agent (mode Agent)**_

That's an excellent insight! Using the LLM's strength in segmentation while keeping the information as text could be the perfect middle ground.

Here's how it could work:

1. **Keep the segmentation capability** from the DigestGenerator, which already breaks content into meaningful chunks

2. **Add importance scoring** to each segment:
   - Have the LLM rate each segment's importance (1-5 scale)
   - Keep only segments above a certain threshold

3. **Maintain segments as plain text** instead of converting to structured JSON facts/relationships

4. **Create a tiered conversation history**:
   - Recent conversations: kept in full
   - Older conversations: replaced with their important segments only
   - Very old segments: summarized further or removed based on continued relevance

5. **Organize segments by topic** (optional):
   - Let the LLM tag each segment with relevant topics
   - Group segments by these topics for better retrieval

This approach gives you:
- Memory compression (only keeping important information)
- Format that's natural for the LLM (plain text)
- Preservation of original wording (avoiding transformation errors)
- Progressive summarization as information ages

You'd still need periodic review to remove redundant segments over time, but this would be a much lighter-weight process than the current structured JSON approach while being more effective than storing everything verbatim.

---

_**User (2025-04-16 03:51Z)**_

Yes. I agree. Let's do it.

---

_**Agent (mode Agent)**_

Let's implement this approach. I'll sketch out how to modify the system to keep important segments as text with a rating system.

+ You are an AI memory system that helps organize and prioritize information. Your task is to rate the importance of text segments and assign relevant topics to each.
+ 
+ The segments below are from a conversation. For each segment:
+ 1. Assign an importance rating from 1-5 (where 5 is extremely important and 1 is not important)
+ 2. Identify relevant topics that the segment relates to
+ 
+ Use these criteria to determine importance:
+ - Higher importance (4-5): New information, key decisions, significant events, core concepts
+ - Medium importance (3): Clarifications, details about important topics, context
+ - Lower importance (1-2): Repetitions, greetings, filler, already known information
+ 
+ Existing memory context:
+ {memory_context}
+ 
+ Segments to rate:
+ {segments}

  Design Principles:
- 1. Flexible Schema Design
-    - Only the top-level structure (static_memory, working_memory, metadata, conversation_history) is fixed
-    - The internal structure of static_memory and working_memory should be determined by the LLM based on the domain
-    - Domain-specific schemas are provided as suggestions, not requirements
+ 1. Flexible Memory Design
+    - Maintains conversation history with importance-rated segments
+    - Uses these rated segments for memory compression over time
     
  2. Domain-Driven Design
     - Domain-specific guidance is provided through domain_config
-    - This includes both prompt instructions and schema suggestions
-    - The LLM should use these as guidance to create an appropriate structure for the domain
+    - The LLM should use these as guidance to remember important information
     
  3. Memory Organization
     - static_memory: Contains foundational, unchanging information about the domain
-    - working_memory: Contains dynamic information learned during interactions
-    - Both sections&#39; internal structure is flexible and domain-dependent
+    - conversation_history: Contains full conversation with important segments rated
+    - context: Contains compressed important information organized by topic
     
  4. Memory Update Process
-    - Periodically analyzes conversation history to update working_memory
-    - Uses domain-specific guidance to determine what information to extract
-    - Updates working_memory structure based on the domain&#39;s needs
+    - Periodically compresses conversation history to retain only important segments
+    - Organizes important information by topics for better retrieval
+    - Balances completeness with efficiency

```json
{
  "static_memory": {
    // memory contents
  }
}
```

But we're still trying to access `memory_data["static_memory"]` directly, which fails if the LLM returns the whole object as expected.

Let's fix this:

The fix looks good. Now let's summarize all the changes we've made to implement our new approach:

1. **DigestGenerator Changes:**
   - Updated to rate segment importance (1-5 scale) instead of extracting facts/relationships
   - Added topic assignment to segments
   - Keeps segments as plain text rather than converting to structured facts

2. **MemoryManager Changes:**
   - Changed memory structure:
     - Kept `static_memory` for foundational knowledge
     - Removed `working_memory` in favor of `context` organized by topics
     - Uses full `conversation_history` with importance-rated segments
   - New compression process:
     - Keeps only recent conversations in full form (configurable limit)
     - Extracts important segments from older conversations (above threshold)
     - Organizes important information by topics in the `context`

3. **Templates Updates:**
   - Added `rate_segments.prompt` for assessing segment importance
   - Added `compress_memory.prompt` for organizing segments by topic
   - Updated other templates to work with the new memory structure

This approach gives us:
- More natural format for LLMs (text rather than rigid JSON)
- Progressive compression that keeps important information
- Better topical organization for retrieval
- Configurability (importance threshold, conversation limit)

The system now leverages the LLM's strength in segmentation and topic organization while avoiding the rigid structured extraction that was causing information loss.

Now all the template files have properly escaped curly braces for Python's `format()` method. This should prevent syntax errors when Python tries to format the templates.

To summarize the changes we made:
1. Doubled all curly braces in JSON examples and response formats
2. Kept the placeholder curly braces (`{memory_state}`, etc.) single since those are meant to be replaced

This should resolve any issues with formatting the templates when they're processed by the Python code.

Now all the templates have been correctly updated with doubled curly braces for JSON syntax. This will allow Python's `string.format()` method to properly render the templates without parsing errors.

The key differences:
1. Single braces like `{memory_state}` are left as-is because these are meant to be replaced by format
2. JSON syntax braces are doubled like `{{` and `}}` to escape them
3. Nested JSON objects have doubly-doubled braces, e.g., `{{"key": "value"}}` for objects inside arrays

This should allow the memory system to function correctly.

_**Agent (mode Agent)**_

Here's a Phase 2 update for your README:

## Phase 2 Update - April 16, 2025 - Text-Based Memory Compression & Segment Importance

We've implemented a significant redesign of the memory system to better leverage the strengths of LLMs:

1. **Text-Based Memory Approach**:
   - Moved from rigid JSON fact structures to a more natural text representation
   - Segments are now preserved in their original form with importance ratings
   - Information is organized by topics rather than formal knowledge graphs

2. **Importance-Based Memory Compression**:
   - DigestGenerator now rates segment importance on a 1-5 scale
   - High-importance segments are retained while low-importance ones are filtered
   - Automatic compression process preserves only valuable information

3. **Progressive Memory Summarization**:
   - Recent conversations are kept in full
   - Older conversations are compressed to important segments only
   - Topics are used to organize important information for better retrieval

4. **Technical Improvements**:
   - Added configurable importance threshold (default: 3)
   - Implemented conversation limit parameters to control memory size
   - Created dedicated templates for rating and compressing information

This approach solves several key challenges from our previous implementation:
- Better leverages how LLMs naturally process information
- Prevents information loss during extraction by keeping original wording
- Reduces redundancy through intelligent filtering and compression
- Maintains traceability back to original conversations

The system now strikes a balance between completeness (retaining important information) and efficiency (managing memory size), while using a format that's more conducive to how LLMs understand and generate text.

```
refactor: Implement text-based memory compression with segment importance

Replace rigid JSON fact structures with importance-rated text segments for more
natural LLM processing. Key improvements:

- DigestGenerator now rates segments on 1-5 importance scale
- Memory compression retains only high-importance segments
- Progressive summarization keeps recent conversations intact
- Organized memory by topics for better retrieval

This approach better leverages LLM strengths, preserves original wording,
reduces redundancy through intelligent filtering, and maintains traceability
to source conversations.

Technical changes:
- Added importance threshold configuration (default: 3)
- Added conversation limit parameters to control memory size
- Created specialized templates for rating and compressing information
- Updated memory structure with context by topic instead of working_memory
```

_**User (2025-04-16 21:13Z)**_

OK. Now that we are using ranked text segments as the basic memory unit, what do you think about changine the create_memory.prompt to save the initial input data as ranked segments?

---

_**Agent (mode Agent)**_

That's an excellent idea! The initial data should use the same segment-based approach as our ongoing conversations for consistency. This would give us several advantages:

1. **Consistent memory representation** from initial setup through ongoing conversations
2. **Pre-ranked importance** of foundational information
3. **Topic organization** from the beginning
4. **Better integration** with the compression mechanism

Let me suggest an updated version of the `create_memory.prompt`:

This update aligns our initial memory creation perfectly with our new memory approach. Here's why this change is beneficial:

1. **Consistency**: We now use the same segment-based format from the beginning, rather than having different formats for initial vs. learned data.

2. **Importance-based foundation**: By rating segments in the initial data, we start with prioritized information and can apply the same compression mechanisms later.

3. **Topic organization**: Information is organized by topic from the start, making retrieval more efficient.

4. **Preserves original wording**: The prompt now explicitly asks to maintain original text where possible, reducing transformation errors.

5. **Clear JSON structure**: The structure directly mirrors how we'll be organizing learned information, making the memory system more coherent.

This approach should work particularly well with domain configurations like your D&D campaign settings, where information naturally breaks into distinct segments about characters, locations, and events - each with varying levels of importance.

Would you like me to update the `MemoryManager` class to properly handle this new initial memory structure?

---

_**User (2025-04-16 21:58Z)**_

OK. This is working better than the previous approach.

Now, when including the memory in the query_memory.prompt it might work better to include only the text from the memory object arrays. The prompt context will be more concise without the JSON formatting.

---

_**Agent (mode Agent)**_

You're absolutely right - removing the JSON formatting and just including the plain text from memory would make the prompt more concise and easier for the LLM to process. Let's update the query template to present memory contents in a cleaner text format:

Great! These updates bring some major improvements to our memory system:

1. **Cleaner, more readable format** for memory content:
   - Static memory is organized by topics with importance indicators
   - Context information includes attribution and importance
   - Recent conversation history is presented in a natural dialog format

2. **More efficient prompts** that:
   - Use less tokens by removing JSON structure
   - Present information in a more natural way
   - Highlight importance with visual indicators (asterisks)

3. **Better organization** of information with:
   - Clear topic headers
   - Visual importance ranking
   - Proper spacing between sections

4. **Improved LLM performance** due to:
   - More natural information format
   - Less parsing overhead for the LLM
   - More focused context

These changes are very much in line with your goal of making the memory system more LLM-friendly. By presenting the information in a format that's closer to natural language, we're leveraging the LLM's strengths rather than forcing it to parse complex JSON structures.

The asterisk-based importance visualization (`*****` for critical information, `*` for less important) is particularly helpful as it gives the LLM an intuitive way to prioritize information without requiring it to interpret numeric values.

These improvements should lead to better responses with lower token usage. Is there anything specific about the formatting that you'd like to adjust?

_**User (2025-04-18 01:47Z)**_

What determines when the memory will update and/or compress

---

_**Agent (mode Agent)**_

The memory compression and update process is triggered based on the number of conversations that have accumulated in the memory. Looking at the code, there are two key factors that determine when this happens:

1. **Conversation Count Threshold**: In the `query_memory` method, there's a check that triggers compression when the number of conversations exceeds `self.max_recent_conversations`:

```python
# Check if we should compress memory based on number of conversations
conversation_count = len(self.memory["conversation_history"]) // 2  # Each conversation is a user-assistant pair
if conversation_count > self.max_recent_conversations:
    print(f"Memory has {conversation_count} conversations, compressing...")
    self.update_memory({"operation": "update"})
```

2. **Configurable Threshold**: The threshold is set in the `__init__` method of the `MemoryManager` class:

```python
# Maximum number of full conversations to keep before compression
self.max_recent_conversations = 10
```

The compression process is handled by `_compress_conversation_history()`, which:

1. Keeps the most recent conversations (determined by `max_recent_conversations`)
2. Extracts important segments from older conversations
3. Only keeps segments with importance ≥ `self.importance_threshold` (default is 3)
4. Organizes these important segments by topic in the `context` section

The memory will therefore update/compress automatically after every 10 conversation pairs (10 user messages and 10 assistant responses), keeping only the most important information from older conversations while maintaining the full text of recent exchanges.

You can adjust these parameters in the `MemoryManager` initialization if you want to change how frequently compression occurs or what importance threshold is used.

---

_**User (2025-04-18 01:50Z)**_

Does this conflict with the Agent's reflection_threshold ?

---

_**Agent (mode Agent)**_

Yes, there's a potential conflict or redundancy between the `MemoryManager`'s compression threshold and the `Agent`'s reflection threshold.

From looking at the code, especially in `agent_usage_example.py`, the Agent has its own separate reflection mechanism:

```python
agent = Agent(llm_service, memory_manager, domain_name="dnd_campaign", reflection_threshold=4)
```

This reflection_threshold (set to 4 in the example) appears to be a separate process from the MemoryManager's compression:

1. **Agent Reflection**: Likely triggers a higher-level reasoning process about the conversation state, potentially updating strategy, goals, or understanding.

2. **MemoryManager Compression**: A lower-level process that simply compresses older conversation history while preserving important segments.

The potential conflicts/issues are:

1. **Duplicate Processing**: Both mechanisms might analyze the same conversations, wasting computational resources.

2. **Competing Updates**: The agent reflection might make memory updates that conflict with or get overwritten by the compression process.

3. **Inconsistent Thresholds**: Having different thresholds (4 vs 10 in the example) means these processes will trigger at different times, potentially causing confusion.

To resolve this, you have several options:

1. **Integrate the processes**: Make the Agent's reflection process use the MemoryManager's compression as part of its reflection.

2. **Coordinated thresholds**: Set both thresholds to the same value so they occur simultaneously.

3. **Clear separation of concerns**: Ensure the Agent's reflection handles high-level understanding while the MemoryManager only handles conversation history management.

For a cleaner architecture, it would make sense to have the Agent's reflection process be the only one that makes semantic updates to memory, while the MemoryManager just handles the technical aspects of compression and storage.

---

_**User (2025-04-18 01:52Z)**_

Ok, I think that memory management should be handled by the MemoryManager without the Agent being aware of it.

---

_**Agent (mode Agent)**_

That's a very sensible approach. Having the MemoryManager handle all memory operations independently keeps a clean separation of concerns:

1. **MemoryManager**: Responsible for all memory maintenance tasks
   - Storing conversations
   - Rating segment importance
   - Compressing older conversations
   - Organizing information by topics
   - Managing memory size and efficiency

2. **Agent**: Focuses on higher-level cognitive operations
   - Making decisions
   - Reasoning about content
   - Generating responses
   - Following goals and intentions
   - Maintaining coherent behavior

This separation means:
- The Agent doesn't need to know about memory implementation details
- The MemoryManager can evolve independently without changing the Agent interface
- It's easier to swap different memory systems for testing and improvement

To ensure this clean separation:
1. Make sure the Agent's reflection mechanism doesn't directly manipulate memory, but instead calls appropriate MemoryManager methods
2. Ensure the MemoryManager exposes a clear interface for the Agent to query and store information
3. The MemoryManager should handle all optimization internally

This approach aligns well with the design principle of encapsulation - the Agent only needs to know what the memory can do, not how it's implemented or maintained behind the scenes.

Would you like me to adjust the code to strengthen this separation of concerns?

---

_**User (2025-04-18 02:02Z)**_

First, please describe the code changes you plan to make.

---

_**Agent (mode Agent)**_

Based on our discussion about having the MemoryManager handle all memory operations independently, I plan to make the following code changes:

1. **Remove Agent's Reflection Mechanism**:
   - Eliminate the reflection counter and threshold from the Agent class
   - Remove the reflection check in `process_message()`
   - Remove the `reflect()` method entirely or convert it to use MemoryManager's capabilities

2. **Update Agent's Initialization**:
   - Remove the `reflection_threshold` parameter from `__init__()`
   - Remove related logging about reflection threshold

3. **Streamline Message Processing**:
   - Have `process_message()` focus only on getting responses through the MemoryManager
   - Rely on MemoryManager's internal compression logic to handle memory management
   - Keep phase transitions for the Agent as they track the agent's cognitive state

4. **Enhance Documentation**:
   - Add comments clarifying the separation of concerns
   - Document that memory management is handled transparently by the MemoryManager

These changes will maintain a clean separation of concerns where:
- The Agent focuses on domain-specific reasoning and response generation
- The MemoryManager handles all memory-related operations (storage, compression, organization)
- Memory management happens automatically without the Agent needing to be aware of it

This approach gives better encapsulation and easier maintenance, as memory optimizations can be implemented without changing the Agent's code.

---

_**User (2025-04-18 02:02Z)**_

Sounds good. Please make the changes.

---

_**Agent (mode Agent)**_

I'll implement the changes to remove the Agent's reflection mechanism and leave memory management fully to the MemoryManager:

The changes are now complete. Here's a summary of what was done:

1. **In Agent Class:**
   - Removed `reflection_threshold` parameter from `__init__`
   - Removed reflection check from `process_message()`
   - Deleted the entire `reflect()` method
   - Updated docstrings to clarify that memory management is handled by MemoryManager

2. **In agent_usage_example.py:**
   - Removed `reflection_threshold` parameter when initializing Agent
   - Removed the 'reflect' command from the interactive session
   - Removed 'reflect' from the help menu

These changes establish a clean separation of concerns:
- The Agent now focuses solely on domain-specific reasoning and response generation
- The MemoryManager handles all memory operations automatically and transparently
- Memory compression happens automatically when needed without Agent intervention

This design is more modular, easier to maintain, and has better encapsulation. The Agent no longer needs to know the internal workings of memory management, and the MemoryManager can be optimized independently without affecting the Agent's behavior.

+    - Agent now focuses solely on domain reasoning and responses
+    - No need to track conversation count or trigger compression
+    - Simpler, more focused implementation with less redundancy
+ 
+ This separation of concerns creates a more maintainable and modular system:
+ - The Agent doesn&#39;t need to know implementation details of memory management
+ - The MemoryManager can evolve independently without affecting Agent behavior
+ - New memory optimization strategies can be implemented without Agent changes
+ - Lower token usage in prompts allows for more efficient processing
+ 
+ The system now follows solid architectural principles with each component having a single responsibility, making the entire framework more robust and easier to extend.

```
refactor: improve separation of concerns between Agent and MemoryManager

Implement clean architectural separation by removing reflection mechanism from
Agent and ensuring all memory management happens transparently within MemoryManager.

Key changes:
- Remove Agent's reflection_threshold parameter and reflect() method
- Eliminate reflection checks in process_message()
- Update agent_usage_example.py to remove reflection commands
- Format memory content as readable text in prompts instead of JSON
- Use asterisk-based importance visualization in text representation
- Add clear documentation about separation of concerns

This change creates a cleaner system architecture where:
- Agent focuses solely on domain reasoning and response generation
- MemoryManager handles all memory operations transparently
- Memory compression happens automatically without Agent intervention
- More efficient token usage through natural language prompts

Improves maintainability, extensibility, and follows single responsibility principle.
