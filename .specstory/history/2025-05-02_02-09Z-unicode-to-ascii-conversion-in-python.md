# Unicode to ASCII Conversion in Python (2025-05-02 02:09Z)

_**User (2025-05-01 14:30Z)**_

Is there a python library that can convert unicode to normal characters

Yes! The `unicodedata` library in Python is perfect for this task. It provides functions to normalize and convert Unicode characters to their ASCII equivalents. Let me modify your code to use this library.

I'll edit your file to use `unicodedata.normalize()` which will properly handle the Unicode characters:

It centers around the Lost Valley \u2013 a hidden valley nestled amongst impassable mountains, and a place brimming with ancient ruins. These ruins are scattered throughout the valley and are known to exhibit strange magical anomalies. \n\nCurrently, the main settlements are Haven, the central hub, Riverwatch to the east, and Mountainkeep to the west. You\u2019ll find merchants seeking protection in Riverwatch as the main road between the settlements has been disrupted, forcing them to find alternative routes. \n\nSpeaking of disruptions, there\u2019s been a rise in monster activity, which is causing concern for everyone. And, naturally, the Master Scholar, Theron, is deeply involved, currently focused on decoding inscriptions found within the newly discovered chambers of the ancient ruins. He believes these inscriptions hold the key to understanding the valley\u2019s history and, perhaps, the source of these unsettling magical anomalies. \n\nDo you have a particular area of the Lost Valley you&#39;d like to focus on, or perhaps a specific question about any of these locations?&quot;

I've updated your code to use the `unicodedata` library, which is part of Python's standard library. Here's what the changes do:

1. Added `import unicodedata` at the top
2. Replaced the previous cleaning method with `unicodedata.normalize('NFKD', llm_response)`
   - `NFKD` means "Normalization Form Compatibility Decomposition"
   - This breaks down Unicode characters into their base form and compatibility equivalents
3. Then we encode to ASCII and decode back to string, using 'ignore' to skip any characters that can't be converted

This will convert Unicode characters like `\u2019` (right single quote) to their ASCII equivalents (`'`). The method is more robust than simple string replacement because it handles all Unicode characters, not just specific ones.

When you run this code, you should see the text with proper ASCII characters instead of Unicode escape sequences. For example, `\u2019` will become `'` and `\u2013` will become `-`.

This does remove the unicode characters, but it does not convert them, it just removes them.

_**Agent (mode Agent)**_

Ah, you're right! I see the issue - the apostrophes and dashes are being removed rather than converted to their ASCII equivalents. Let me modify the code to properly convert them:

I've modified the code to use a two-step process:
1. First, we normalize the text using `unicodedata.normalize('NFKD', llm_response)` which breaks down Unicode characters into their base form
2. Then, instead of using 'ignore' which removes characters, we use 'replace' which will replace characters with their closest ASCII equivalent

This should now properly convert:
- `\u2019` (right single quote) to `'`
- `\u2013` (en dash) to `-`
- And other Unicode characters to their ASCII equivalents

The output should now show proper apostrophes and dashes instead of removing them. Let me know if you'd like to try a different approach if this doesn't give the desired results!

This seems like a hard problem. It is not, yet working:

_**Agent (mode Agent)**_

You're right - let's try a simpler approach using string replacements. Since we know exactly which Unicode characters we're dealing with, we can just replace them directly:

I've simplified the approach to just use direct string replacements. This should now properly convert:
- `\u2019` to `'` (apostrophe)
- `\u2013` to `-` (dash)

This is a more straightforward solution since we know exactly which Unicode characters we need to handle. The output should now show proper apostrophes and dashes instead of question marks or other unexpected characters.

Let me know if you see any other Unicode characters that need to be converted and we can add more replacements to the chain!

OK. Let's make this handle more cases:

Ah, I see you have a comprehensive list of Unicode replacements! Let's update the code to handle all these cases:

I've updated the code to use a comprehensive dictionary of Unicode replacements that handles:
- Various types of dashes (en-dash, em-dash)
- Different types of quotes (single and double quotes)
- Ellipsis
- Non-breaking spaces
- Degree symbols
- Accented characters (é, è, à, á, â, ä, ç, ñ, ó, ö, ú, ü)

The code now iterates through all these replacements and applies them to the text. This should handle most common Unicode characters that might appear in text and convert them to their ASCII equivalents.

The approach is more maintainable than the previous version because:
1. All replacements are defined in one place
2. Each replacement has a comment explaining what it is
3. It's easy to add new replacements if needed

Let me know if you'd like to add any other Unicode characters to the replacement dictionary!
