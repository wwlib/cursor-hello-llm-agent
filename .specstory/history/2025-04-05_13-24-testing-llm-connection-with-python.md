# Testing LLM Connection with Python (2025-04-05 09:24:47)

_**User**_

Let's run:

python examples/call_ollama.py

To test the connection to the LLM


---

_**Assistant**_

I'll run that command to test the connection to the LLM.

---

```bash
python examples/call_ollama.py
```

```
Testing Ollama API...
Sending request to Ollama...

```

---

The command failed with a connection error. It's trying to connect to an Ollama instance at IP 192.168.1.173 but can't establish a connection (error: "No route to host").

Let's check the configuration in the script to see how the Ollama connection is set up.

---

Read file: examples/call_ollama.py

---

The issue is that the script is trying to connect to Ollama at `http://192.168.1.173:11434/api/generate`, but the connection is failing. However, in the `main()` function, it first tries to check if Ollama is running at `http://localhost:11434/api/tags`, but then calls `test_ollama_call()` which uses a different IP address.

Let's modify the script to use localhost for the API call as well:

---

Cancelled

---

Now let's run the script again to test if it can connect to Ollama on localhost:

---

Cancelled

---

Let's try again:

---

Cancelled

---

I apologize for the confusion. It seems the command is being rejected. Let's first check if the Python script exists and is accessible:

---

</details>

---

The file exists. Let's try running it with a different command to ensure we have the right permissions:

---

Cancelled

---

Let's check if we can run a basic Python script:

---

Cancelled

---

_**User**_

The correct URL is:

@http://192.168.1.173:11434/api/generate 

I can see in the browser that ollama is wworking

---

_**Assistant**_

If Ollama is working at `http://192.168.1.173:11434/api/generate`, let's revert the change and update the health check to also use that URL instead of localhost:

---

```diff
      # First check if Ollama is running
      try:
-         health_check = requests.get("http://localhost:11434/api/tags")
+         health_check = requests.get("http://192.168.1.173:11434/api/tags")
          health_check.raise_for_status()
      except requests.exceptions.RequestException:
```

---

Now let's run the script again:

---

```bash
python examples/call_ollama.py
```

Great! The connection to Ollama was successful. The script correctly sent a request to the Ollama API at 192.168.1.173:11434 and received a JSON response in the expected format. The Ollama LLM properly processed the test prompt and returned structured data about the fantasy world scenario.

_**User**_

I am getting an error when I try to run call_ollama.py from the terminal:



---

_**Assistant**_

You're missing the `requests` module in your Python environment. You need to install it before running the script.

---

Cancelled

---

_**User**_

But I think requests is already installed - it is in requirements.txt



---

_**Assistant**_

Let's check if requests is installed and if there are any other issues that might be causing the error:

---

```bash
python -c "import requests; print('requests is installed')"
```

```
(base) andrewrapo@Andrews-MacBook-Pro-16b cursor-hello-llm-agent % python -c "import requests; print('reques
ts is installed')"                                                 python -c "import requests; print('reques
ts is installed')"
requests is installed
(base) andrewrapo@Andrews-MacBook-Pro-16b cursor-hello-llm-agent %
```

---

The requests library is indeed installed. Let's check the call_ollama.py script in more detail and try to run it with more verbose output to see what specific error you're getting:

```bash
python examples/call_ollama.py 2>&1

The script is actually running successfully now - I can see a complete response from the Ollama API. The script connects to the Ollama instance at 192.168.1.173:11434, sends the test prompt, and receives a properly formatted JSON response.

If you're still experiencing errors when running it from the terminal yourself, it could be due to:

1. Different Python environment/version
2. Network connectivity issues (temporary)
3. Different working directory (make sure you're in the project root when running the script)
4. Missing dependencies in your specific environment

Could you share the specific error message you're getting when you run it from your terminal?

---

_**User**_

Maybe the terminal does not see the correct python environment?

---

_**Assistant**_

You're right. The error shows that you're running Python from a virtual environment (`.venv`), but that environment doesn't have the `requests` module installed, even though it's in your requirements.txt file.

Let's install the requests module in your virtual environment:

---

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate && pip install requests
```

```
(base) andrewrapo@Andrews-MacBook-Pro-16b cursor-hello-llm-agent % source .venv/bin/activate && pip install 
requests                                                           source .venv/bin/activate && pip install

Great! I've successfully installed the `requests` module in your `.venv` virtual environment. Now you should be able to run the script from your terminal without the "ModuleNotFoundError" error.

This was happening because:

1. You have multiple Python environments - a base environment and a virtual environment (`.venv`)
2. When you ran the script in your terminal, you were using the virtual environment (as seen by the `(.venv)` prefix in your prompt)
3. The `requests` package was installed in your base environment but not in the virtual environment

Now when you run `python examples/call_ollama.py` in your terminal with the virtual environment active, it should work correctly since the `requests` module is now installed in that environment.

---

_**User**_

That worked. But why was did Cursor terminal have requests installed. Is it using a different environment?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, the Cursor terminal was using a different Python environment compared to your local terminal. The difference is:

1. **Cursor terminal**: Was using your base/system Python environment (indicated by the `(base)` prefix in the prompt), which already had the `requests` module installed.

2. **Your local terminal**: Was using the project's virtual environment (indicated by the `(.venv)` prefix), which didn't have `requests` installed until we just added it.

This happens because:

- The Cursor terminal by default uses your system's environment settings
- Your local terminal might be configured to automatically activate the project's virtual environment (`.venv`) when you navigate to the project directory

When you run Python commands in different environments, they have different sets of installed packages. The base/system environment often has more packages installed globally, while virtual environments are usually more isolated with only project-specific dependencies.

This is actually a good practice for development - using virtual environments helps keep project dependencies isolated and makes projects more portable across different machines.

---

_**User**_

Can I get Cursor to use the same virtual environment?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, you can get Cursor to use the same virtual environment. Here's how to do it:

---

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

```
(.venv) (base) andrewrapo@Andrews-MacBook-Pro-16b cursor-hello-llm-agent % 

```

---

Great! I've activated the `.venv` virtual environment in the Cursor terminal. You can see the `(.venv)` prefix in the prompt indicating that the virtual environment is now active.

Now when you run Python commands in the Cursor terminal, they will use the same virtual environment as your local terminal, with the same set of installed packages.

To make this permanent for Cursor, you have a few options:

1. **Add to your project settings**: In Cursor, you can configure the project to automatically activate the virtual environment when opening a terminal. Look for a project configuration file or settings.

2. **Use a .env file**: Create a `.env` file in your project directory with the path to your virtual environment.

3. **Add to your shell profile**: In your shell profile file (like `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`), you can add logic to automatically activate the virtual environment when you navigate to this project directory.

4. **Manual activation**: As we just did, you can manually run `source .venv/bin/activate` each time you start a new terminal in Cursor.

For now, the virtual environment is activated in this Cursor terminal session. Any Python scripts you run will use this environment and its installed packages.
