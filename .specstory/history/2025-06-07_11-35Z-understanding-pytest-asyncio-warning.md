# Understanding pytest asyncio warning (2025-06-07 11:35Z)

_**User**_

Do you understand this error?

_**Assistant**_

Yes, I understand this error and warning.

### What the message means

You are seeing a **PytestDeprecationWarning** from the `pytest-asyncio` plugin:

```
The configuration option "asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope" is unset.
The event loop scope for asynchronous fixtures will default to the fixture caching scope. Future versions of pytest-asyncio will default the loop scope for asynchronous fixtures to function scope. Set the default fixture loop scope explicitly in order to avoid unexpected behavior in the future. Valid fixture loop scopes are: "function", "class", "module", "package", "session"
```

#### Explanation

- **pytest-asyncio** is a plugin that allows you to test async code with pytest.
- It manages the event loop used for async tests and fixtures.
- The "event loop scope" determines how long the event loop lives (per test function, per class, per module, etc).
- Currently, because you have not set the `asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope` option, it uses a default that will change in the future.
- The warning is telling you to set this option explicitly to avoid future breakage or unexpected behavior.

#### What you should do

To silence the warning and future-proof your tests, add the following to your `pytest` configuration (usually in `pytest.ini`, `pyproject.toml`, or `conftest.py`):

**For function scope (recommended for most cases):**

```ini
# pytest.ini
[pytest]
asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope = function
```

or in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope = "function"
```

Or, if you want a different scope (e.g., "module", "session"), set it accordingly.

---

**Summary:**  
This is a warning, not a test failure. It is about future compatibility with `pytest-asyncio`. Set the `asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope` option in your pytest config to remove the warning and ensure consistent behavior.

Let me know if you want the exact config for your setup!
