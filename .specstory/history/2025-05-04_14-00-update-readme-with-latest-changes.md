  These changes provide a solid foundation for implementing semantic search and RAG capabilities in the memory system.
+ 
+ ## Phase 2 Update - May 05, 2025 - RAG Implementation & Embedding Integration
+ 
+ We've implemented the foundation for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities:
+ 
+ 1. **Embeddings Integration with LLM Service**:
+    - Added comprehensive embedding generation support in both `LLMService` and `OllamaService`
+    - Implemented proper vector normalization, validation, and error handling
+    - Added support for both `/api/embed` and `/api/embeddings` endpoints in the Ollama implementation
+ 
+ 2. **EmbeddingsManager Implementation**:
+    - Created a full-featured embeddings manager to handle storage and retrieval
+    - Implemented semantic search capabilities using cosine similarity
+    - Added support for filtering results by importance and date ranges
+    - Ensured proper handling of conversation history entries and segments
+ 
+ 3. **RAG Architecture Foundation**:
+    - Implemented `RAGManager` class structure for enhanced memory retrieval
+    - Designed interfaces for memory indexing and semantic search
+    - Created framework for efficiently retrieving contextually relevant information
+    - Established clear integration points with memory system components
+ 
+ 4. **Testing Framework**:
+    - Added comprehensive tests for embedding functionality
+    - Implemented proper test file management with temporary directories
+    - Created tests to verify semantic similarity properties
+    - Ensured all tests start with clean state for reproducibility
+ 
+ These changes lay the groundwork for significantly improving the agent's ability to retrieve and utilize relevant information from past conversations. The semantic search capabilities will enable more contextually appropriate responses by drawing on the most pertinent historical information, while the RAG architecture provides a scalable framework for future enhancements to memory retrieval and utilization.
+ 
+ Next steps include implementing the search functions to enable retrieving information from both memory and conversation history, developing visualization tools for memory analysis, and enhancing the system with batch embedding operations for efficiency.

I've updated the README-phase-2.md with a comprehensive summary of the latest RAG implementation and embedding integration changes. The new section highlights:

1. The embedding generation capabilities added to the LLM service classes
2. The implementation of the EmbeddingsManager for semantic search
3. The RAG architecture foundation for enhanced memory retrieval
4. The testing framework improvements

The update follows the same format as previous entries and includes next steps for the project, focusing on implementing search functions, memory visualization tools, and batch embedding operations for improved efficiency.

feat(memory): implement RAG capabilities with embedding integration

Added foundation for Retrieval Augmented Generation functionality including:
- Embedding generation support in LLMService and OllamaService
- EmbeddingsManager for storage and semantic search
- RAG architecture with memory indexing interfaces
- Comprehensive test suite for embedding functionality

This enhances the agent's ability to retrieve contextually relevant information from conversation history using semantic similarity.
