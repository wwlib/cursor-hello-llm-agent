⏺ Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Read README-phase-5.md for context on Phase 5 graph memory system development
     ☒ Read phase-5-june-07-2025-4.md for recent graph viewer implementation details
     ☐ Create bulleted list of updates for git commit message about new graph-viewer

⏺ Based on my reading of the context files, here's a bulleted list of updates for the git commit message about
   the new graph-viewer:

Interactive Memory Graph Viewer Implementation:

- React-based Graph Visualization Tool: Created comprehensive web application in graph-viewer/ directory for exploring LLM Agent Framework knowledge graphs
- Force-Directed Interactive Graph: Implemented using react-force-graph-2d with physics-based visualization, zoom/pan controls, and smooth navigation
- Entity Type Color Coding: Added visual distinction for 6 entity types (character=red, location=teal, object=blue, event=yellow, concept=purple, organization=cyan) with interactive legend
- Relationship Visualization: Directional arrows showing relationship flows with thickness proportional to weight and confidence indicators
- Interactive Node Details: Click functionality to view comprehensive entity information including name, type, description, aliases, mention count, and timestamps
- File Loading Capabilities: Drag-and-drop file upload support for custom graph data plus pre-loaded D&D campaign sample data
- Data Pipeline Integration: Direct compatibility with GraphStorage JSON format (graph_nodes.json, graph_edges.json) from agent memory directories
- Automated Data Management: Copy script (scripts/copy-graph-data.sh) for seamless data transfer from agent memories to viewer
- Comprehensive Documentation: Created README.md, USAGE.md, and updated README-phase-5.md with installation, usage instructions, and technical details
- Development Infrastructure: Complete React project structure with npm scripts, dependencies, and responsive CSS styling
- Real-time Workflow Support: Enables live visualization of knowledge graph evolution as conversations build structured knowledge
