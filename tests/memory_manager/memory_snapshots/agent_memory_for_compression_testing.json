Sara, Captain of Riverwatch, believes the increased monster activity is linked to the magical anomalies within the ruins, and she\u2019s provided you with a preliminary assessment.\n\nSpecifically, she\u2019s pinpointed a cluster of new chambers discovered just outside the main ruins complex \u2013 those are the source of the strange energy emanations and the recent surge in monster activity. She suspects a corrupted magical creature might be drawn to the anomalies, feeding off the chaotic energy.\n\nBefore you head out, I want to offer a small piece of advice. Theron, our Master Scholar, has been studying the inscriptions within those new chambers and believes there might be a key to understanding \u2013 and potentially controlling \u2013 the magical effects. He\u2019s requested you bring him back any unusual artifacts you discover. \n\nI\u2019ll send Sara along with you to provide support and coordinate with the merchants. She\u2019s particularly concerned about the caravan\u2019s safety, so let\u2019s prioritize neutralizing the threat swiftly. \n\nDo you have any questions before we set off?",
