The Mayor of Haven, Elena, has received reports of a band of goblins raiding caravans along the old trade routes. She's willing to pay a reward to anyone who can clear them out and secure the road. \n\nMore specifically, she's heard the goblins are particularly interested in the recently discovered artifacts within the ruins near Riverwatch. Eliminating the threat and recovering any lost valuables would be a solid start. She's offering 50 gold pieces for the task, plus a share of any recovered artifacts.\n\nWould you like me to tell you more about the goblins - perhaps their numbers or any known weaknesses - before you decide to take on this quest?",
