Captain Sara of Riverwatch suspects a connection between the increased monster activity and the anomalies within the ruins, specifically believing the caravan is headed into danger. Sara requests adventurers to investigate the ruins ahead of the caravan's route to identify and neutralize the source of the monster activity, potentially uncovering a valuable artifact. This investigation could yield a reward of 50 gold pieces while addressing a significant threat.",
