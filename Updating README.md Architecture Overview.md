I've updated the README.md with a comprehensive architecture overview that:

1. Describes the three main components (LLM Service, Memory Management, Agent Layer)
2. Details the key features of each component
3. Explains the memory structure and phase management
4. Highlights important features like automatic reflection and debug logging
5. Describes the D&D campaign example implementation

The overview provides a clear picture of how the components work together while remaining general enough to show how the system could be used for other applications beyond D&D campaigns.

Would you like me to make any adjustments to the architecture overview?
