# README-phase-4

## Overall Goals

- Create an Agent Framework that can be used for a variety of purposes
- Use the Agent Framework as a tool to help continually improve this Agent Framework (i.e. make the framework "self-hosted")
  - Including acting as the project ProjectManager/ScrumMaster
- Use the Agent Framework to create an Agent that can act like a "Jarvis" in a home workshop to assist with projects and preserve project details - like a voice-driven lab notebook
- Use the Agent Framework to power a DND Dungeon Master agent


## TODO

- Make sure that user queries are being answered appropriately
  - It seems that simple queries may be ignored by the query prompt
    - It looks like new user queries are included in both the recent converstaion history and the user query section of the query prompt
  - Suggest that user queries and commands be treated differently
    - Might not need segmentation and digesting
    - Segmentatino and digesting is only needed if the user is providing information
- Agent Improvements - RAG Integration
  - RAG should prioritize semantic search results using the segment classifications
    - i.e. filter out user commands (type == command) when only information (type == information)
    - i.e. prioritize segments with higer importance
  - When appropriate, look up other segments in the same conversation entry to see if they should be inclueded
    - might require another LLM call to determine which to include
- Add metadata to track memory usage statistics and performance
- Develop tools for memory visualization and analysis
- Review all tests and fix or clean up as needed


## Phase 4 Update - May 31, 2025 - Improvements to Digest Topics

Summary of Improvements Implemented

  1. Topic Assignment Improvements

  - ✅ Domain-specific topic taxonomy with hierarchical categories
  - ✅ Topic normalization for consistency (e.g., "ancient ruins" → "Objects", "monster activity" → "Threats")
  - ✅ Standardized capitalization (Title Case)
  - ✅ Domain-specific prompting with suggested topics for each domain

  2. Quality Results from Test

  The improved system now produces:
  - Consistent topics: "World", "Environment", "Objects", "Magic", "Threats", "Characters"
  - Appropriate importance ratings: 3-5 scale with essential ruins/magic getting 5, general descriptions getting 3-4
  - Domain-relevant categorization: Topics align with D&D campaign needs
  - Reduced redundancy: No more overlapping topics like "Location"+"Geography"

  3. LLM-Evaluated Testing Framework

  - ✅ Comprehensive evaluation system that uses LLM to assess digest quality
  - ✅ Multi-domain testing (D&D, Lab Assistant, General)
  - ✅ Topic consistency validation across multiple conversation entries
  - ✅ Quality scoring on 6 criteria: segmentation, importance, topic relevance, consistency, type classification, completeness

  4. Key Technical Enhancements

  - TopicTaxonomy class manages domain-specific vocabularies and normalization rules
  - Integrated into DigestGenerator with domain-aware initialization
  - Updated prompt templates include domain-specific guidance
  - Backward compatibility maintained with existing memory managers

  The topic assignment is now significantly more consistent, domain-relevant, and useful for RAG operations. Both todo items have been completed successfully!


## Phase 4 Update - May 31, 2025 - Improved Topic Classification & Memory Context Redundancy Reduction

  Summary of Phase 4 Memory Improvements

  1. ✅ Improved Topic Classification & Memory Context Redundancy Reduction

  Key Improvements:
  - Enhanced compression prompt with strict redundancy elimination instructions
  - "NO_NEW_INFORMATION" detection to skip creating context entries when no new information exists
  - Context consolidation system that automatically merges similar context entries (0.35 similarity threshold)
  - Improved importance rating with emphasis on NEW information vs redundant information
  - Better prompting that explicitly instructs the LLM to avoid restating known facts

  Technical Enhancements:
  - Updated compress_memory.prompt with critical instructions for redundancy elimination
  - Added _consolidate_context_entries() method with Jaccard similarity detection
  - Added _entries_are_similar() and _merge_similar_entries() methods
  - Enhanced memory compressor to handle "NO_NEW_INFORMATION" responses
  - Updated importance scale to emphasize detecting redundant vs new information

  2. ✅ Moved Domain-Specific Topic Guidance to domain_configs.py

  Key Changes:
  - Centralized configuration - all domain-specific topic taxonomies and normalizations now live in domain_configs.py
  - Cleaner architecture - TopicTaxonomy class loads from domain config instead of hard-coded data
  - Backward compatibility - fallback to built-in taxonomies if config not provided
  - Enhanced domain configs with topic_taxonomy and topic_normalizations sections

  Technical Implementation:
  - Updated DND_CONFIG and LAB_ASSISTANT_CONFIG with topic configuration sections
  - Modified TopicTaxonomy to accept and load from domain_config parameter
  - Updated DigestGenerator and MemoryManager to pass domain config through the chain
  - Updated all tests to use the new configuration-based approach

  Results:
  The memory system now produces much cleaner, less redundant context with consistent topic assignment based on domain-specific vocabularies that are easily configurable without code
  changes.

  Both TODO items from README-phase-4.md have been completed successfully! The memory system should now be significantly more efficient at avoiding redundant information storage while
  maintaining consistent, domain-appropriate topic assignments.

## Phase 4 Update - Juune 01, 2025 - Balanced Redundancy Detection

  Our comprehensive LLM-evaluated testing shows the Phase 4 improvements are working exceptionally well:

  📊 Outstanding LLM Evaluation Scores

  - Overall Effectiveness: 8.4/10 (improved from 8.2/10)
  - Information Preservation: 10/10 - Perfect retention of important information
  - Redundancy Reduction: 9/10 - Excellent elimination of redundant content
  - Context Efficiency: 8/10 - Strong prevention of memory bloat

  ✅ Key Achievements

  1. Balanced Redundancy Detection
  - ✅ Correctly filters redundant information (Mayor Elena quest info already in static memory)
  - ✅ Preserves genuinely new information (magical swords, dragon discoveries)
  - ✅ Context growth ratio: 0.00 for redundant conversations
  - ✅ Appropriate context creation for truly new discoveries

  2. Improved Prompts Working Effectively
  - Enhanced digest rating properly distinguishes new vs redundant information
  - Rebalanced compression preserves specifics while eliminating exact repetitions
  - "NO_NEW_INFORMATION" detection working appropriately
  - Topic normalization creating consistent, domain-relevant classifications

  3. Technical Enhancements Proven
  - Context consolidation preventing similar entry buildup
  - Improved importance ratings with emphasis on NEW information
  - Domain-specific configurations successfully moved to domain_configs.py
  - Backward compatibility maintained throughout

  🎓 Key Learning: Appropriate Selectivity

  Our system correctly identifies that conversations asking "what quests does Elena have?" are redundant when the static memory already contains detailed information about Elena's role
   and current quest offerings. This is exactly the right behavior - the system should only store context for genuinely new developments.

  🚀 Phase 4 Success Summary

  Both TODO items have been completed successfully with excellent results:

  1. ✅ "Improve topic classification in digests so that only relevant, non-redundant info is persisted in the memory context" - ACHIEVED with 9/10 redundancy reduction score
  2. ✅ "Move domain-specific topic guidance to domain_configs.py" - COMPLETED with full backward compatibility
