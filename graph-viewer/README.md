# Memory Graph Viewer

A React-based visualization tool for viewing knowledge graphs from the LLM Agent Framework's graph memory system.

## Features

- **Interactive Graph Visualization**: Force-directed graph layout with zoom and pan
- **Entity Type Color Coding**: Different colors for characters, locations, objects, events, concepts, and organizations
- **Relationship Visualization**: Directional arrows showing relationships between entities
- **Node Details**: Click any node to see detailed information including description, aliases, and creation time
- **File Loading**: Load your own graph data files (JSON format)
- **Sample Data**: Pre-loaded with D&D campaign data for demonstration

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server on http://localhost:3000

## Data Format

The graph viewer expects two JSON files:

### Nodes File (graph_nodes.json)
```json
{
  "node_id": {
    "id": "node_id",
    "type": "character|location|object|event|concept|organization",
    "name": "Entity Name",
    "description": "Description of the entity",
    "aliases": ["alias1", "alias2"],
    "mention_count": 5,
    "created_at": "2025-06-07T16:18:37.676418",
    "updated_at": "2025-06-07T16:18:37.676427"
  }
}
```

### Edges File (graph_edges.json)
```json
[
  {
    "id": "edge_id",
    "from_node_id": "source_node_id",
    "to_node_id": "target_node_id", 
    "relationship": "relationship_type",
    "weight": 1.0,
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "evidence": "Text evidence for this relationship"
  }
]
```

## Controls

- **Left Click Node**: View node details
- **Right Click Node**: Focus camera on node
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out
- **Drag**: Pan the graph
- **Reset View Button**: Fit all nodes in view

## Entity Types

- **Character** (Red): People, NPCs, player characters
- **Location** (Teal): Places, areas, regions
- **Object** (Blue): Items, artifacts, tools
- **Event** (Yellow): Actions, occurrences, happenings
- **Concept** (Purple): Ideas, abstractions, magic
- **Organization** (Cyan): Groups, factions, institutions

## Relationship Types

- **located_in**: Spatial containment
- **owns**: Ownership relationships
- **member_of**: Membership in groups
- **allies_with** / **enemies_with**: Social relationships
- **uses** / **created_by**: Object interactions
- **leads_to**: Sequential connections
- **participates_in**: Event participation
- **related_to**: General associations

## Sample Data

The viewer includes sample data from a D&D campaign featuring:
- Characters like Elena (Mayor), Theron (Scholar), and Sara (Captain)
- Locations like The Lost Valley, Haven, and ancient ruins
- Objects like magical artifacts
- Concepts like magical anomalies and energy emanations

## Integration with LLM Agent Framework

This viewer is designed to work with graph data generated by the LLM Agent Framework's graph memory system. To view your own agent's memory:

1. Navigate to your agent's memory directory: `agent_memories/standard/{your_agent_guid}/agent_memory_graph_data/`
2. Copy the `graph_nodes.json` and `graph_edges.json` files
3. Use the file upload controls in the viewer to load your data

## Development

The project uses:
- React 19.1.0
- react-force-graph-2d for graph visualization
- d3-force for physics simulation

To modify the visualization:
- Node appearance: Edit `getNodeColor()` and node sizing logic
- Link appearance: Edit `getLinkColor()` and link width logic
- Layout: Adjust d3-force parameters in the ForceGraph2D component
