# README-phase-5

## Overall Goals

- Create an Agent Framework that can be used for a variety of purposes
- Use the Agent Framework as a tool to help continually improve this Agent Framework (i.e. make the framework "self-hosted")
  - Including acting as the project ProjectManager/ScrumMaster
- Use the Agent Framework to create an Agent that can act like a "Jarvis" in a home workshop to assist with projects and preserve project details - like a voice-driven lab notebook
- Use the Agent Framework to power a DND Dungeon Master agent


## TODO

- First (minor): conversation digests should be saved to the conversation history file.
- Knowledge Graph/Reason Graph
  - Develop a simple graph module that can store a graph representation of conversation memory
- RAG Improvements
  - When appropriate, look up other segments in the same conversation entry to see if they should be inclueded
    - might require another LLM call to determine which to include
- Add metadata to track memory usage statistics and performance
- Develop tools for memory visualization and analysis
- Review all tests and fix or clean up as needed
