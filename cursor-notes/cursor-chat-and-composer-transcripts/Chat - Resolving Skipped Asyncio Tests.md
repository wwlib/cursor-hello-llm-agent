## Resolving Skipped Asyncio Tests in Pytest (12/31/2024, 9:23:10 AM)

Why are some of the tests getting skipped - like the asyncio tests?

Ah, I see the issue! The warning message is telling us that you need to install a pytest plugin to handle async tests. Since your tests are using `@pytest.mark.asyncio`, you need to install the `pytest-asyncio` package to properly run these async tests.

To fix this:

1. Install pytest-asyncio:
```bash
pip install pytest-asyncio
```

2. Then, you'll need to either:
   - Add a global pytest marker in your `conftest.py` file, or
   - Add `pytest.ini` configuration, or
   - Add the `pytestmark` at the top of your test file

Here's how to add it to your test file:

```python:tests/agent/test_agent.py
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch
import json
from datetime import datetime

pytestmark = pytest.mark.asyncio  # Add this line at the top of the file

# ... rest of your test file remains the same ...
```

After making these changes, your async tests should run properly instead of being skipped. The `pytest-asyncio` plugin provides the necessary infrastructure to handle asynchronous test functions in pytest.

If you prefer using a `pytest.ini` configuration file instead, you could create one in your project root with:

```ini:pytest.ini
[pytest]
asyncio_mode = auto
```

Either approach will work to enable the async test support.

Could I add the marker to  pyproject.toml?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, absolutely! You can add pytest configuration to your `pyproject.toml` file. Here's how to add the asyncio marker:

```toml:pyproject.toml
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
asyncio_mode = "auto"
```

This is equivalent to the `pytest.ini` configuration and is actually the more modern way to configure pytest when you're already using `pyproject.toml`. The `asyncio_mode = "auto"` setting will automatically handle async tests without requiring explicit markers.

Also, don't forget to add `pytest-asyncio` to your requirements. You can add it to your existing `requirements.txt`:

```requirements.txt
pytest>=7.0.0
pytest-asyncio>=0.23.0  # Add this line
openai>=1.0.0
requests>=2.31.0
urllib3<2.0.0
-e .
```

Or if you're managing dependencies in `pyproject.toml`, you can add it there under your dependencies section.
