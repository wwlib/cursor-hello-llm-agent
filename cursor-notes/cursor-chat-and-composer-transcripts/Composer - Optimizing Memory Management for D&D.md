## Optimizing Memory Management for D&D (1/4/2025, 1:16:46 PM)

_**User**_

OK. Let's focus on the way the memory manager updates the memory. There 2 main sections in the memory: structured_data and knowledge_graph. Up until now, these 2 sections have been alittle redundant so let's fix that.

The overal goal for the memory is to accumulate data that will be included as context in interaction prompts. The memory needs to be rich but also concise and efficient.

The structured data section should contain information about entities - nouns. For a D&D compaign in would contain the players inventory, etc.

The knowledge_graph section should store information aobut relationships - verbs. It should use an efficient shorthand like (player)-[LIKES]-(cheese) or (monster1)-[HAS_A]-(magic-axe). Details about mosnter1 and magic-axe should be kept in the structured_data section.

Does this make sense and seem like a good approach?



---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, this makes perfect sense and is a much clearer separation of concerns between the two memory sections. This approach follows established knowledge representation patterns where:

1. `structured_data`: Acts as a "dictionary" or "entity store" containing detailed information about individual entities (nouns/things)
2. `knowledge_graph`: Captures relationships (verbs/actions/states) between entities using a graph-like structure with clear subject-predicate-object patterns

Let me analyze the current implementation to see how we can improve it:

Looking at the current implementation and the examples in the logs, I can see that we need to make some changes to better align with your vision. Let me summarize what I see and propose the changes:

Current Issues:
1. The knowledge graph structure is inconsistent and often redundant with structured data
2. The structured data sometimes contains relationship information that should be in the knowledge graph
3. The knowledge graph format varies between different styles (sometimes using arrays, sometimes nested objects)

Proposed Changes:
1. Make `structured_data` strictly for entity information (nouns):
   - Each entity should have a unique identifier
   - Store all properties/attributes of entities here
   - No relationship information

2. Make `knowledge_graph` strictly for relationships (verbs):
   - Use the triple format: (subject)-[predicate]-(object)
   - All entities referenced must exist in structured_data
   - Keep it flat and consistent

Let me show you an example of how this would look:

```json
{
  "structured_data": {
    "entities": {
      "mountain_troll_1": {
        "type": "troll",
        "name": "Mountain Troll",
        "height": 12,
        "skin_color": "grey",
        "location": "mountain cave"
      },
      "village_1": {
        "type": "settlement",
        "name": "Eastern Village"
      },
      "magic_axe_1": {
        "type": "weapon",
        "name": "Magic Axe",
        "damage": "2d6"
      }
    }
  },
  "knowledge_graph": {
    "relationships": [
      {
        "subject": "mountain_troll_1",
        "predicate": "ATTACKS",
        "object": "village_1"
      },
      {
        "subject": "mountain_troll_1",
        "predicate": "FEARS",
        "object": "fire"
      },
      {
        "subject": "mountain_troll_1",
        "predicate": "HAS_A",
        "object": "magic_axe_1"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Would you like me to update the memory manager implementation to enforce this cleaner separation between entities and relationships?

---

_**User**_

Before you make the changes it will be important to also update the prompts used to initialize and update the memory - to provide the LLM with clear instructions.

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, absolutely. Let me propose the updated prompts that will guide the LLM to maintain this clear separation between entities and relationships.

1. First, the Create Memory Prompt:

```text
You are a memory management system. Your task is to analyze the provided information and create two distinct data structures:

1. structured_data: A catalog of entities (nouns) and their properties
2. knowledge_graph: A collection of relationships (verbs) between entities

Input Data:
{INPUT_DATA}

Requirements for structured_data:
- Create a unique ID for each entity
- Store ONLY properties/attributes of entities (no relationships)
- Each entity must have at minimum: id, type, name
- Group all entities under an "entities" object
- Example format:
  "entities": {
    "troll_1": {
      "type": "monster",
      "name": "Mountain Troll",
      "height": 12,
      "skin_color": "grey"
    }
  }

Requirements for knowledge_graph:
- Store ONLY relationships between entities
- Use subject-predicate-object triples
- Reference entities by their IDs from structured_data
- Use UPPERCASE for predicates
- Example format:
  "relationships": [
    {
      "subject": "troll_1",
      "predicate": "ATTACKS",
      "object": "village_1"
    }
  ]

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with this structure:
{
    "structured_data": {
        "entities": {
            // entity_id -> properties mapping
        }
    },
    "knowledge_graph": {
        "relationships": [
            // array of relationship triples
        ]
    },
    "metadata": {
        "created_at": "",
        "last_updated": "",
        "version": "1.0"
    }
}
```

2. The Update Memory Prompt:

```text
You are a memory management system. Your task is to incorporate new information while maintaining the strict separation between entities and relationships.

Current Memory State:
{MEMORY_JSON}

New Information:
{NEW_DATA}

Requirements:
1. For structured_data:
   - Add new entities with unique IDs
   - Update properties of existing entities if new information is provided
   - NEVER include relationship information here

2. For knowledge_graph:
   - Add new relationships as subject-predicate-object triples
   - Update existing relationships if contradicted
   - ONLY reference entity IDs that exist in structured_data
   - Use UPPERCASE for predicates

3. Maintain Consistency:
   - Preserve existing entity IDs
   - Preserve existing relationship structure
   - Only add/update based on new information

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with the same structure as the current memory state.
```

3. The Query Memory Prompt:

```text
You are a memory management system. Your task is to answer queries using the structured memory state.

Current Memory State:
{MEMORY_JSON}

Query:
{QUERY}

Requirements:
1. Use both structured_data and knowledge_graph to form complete answers
2. Reference entities by their names (not IDs) in your response
3. Use relationship information to explain connections
4. Maintain consistency with the stored information

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with this structure:
{
    "response": "Your natural language response to the query",
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
    "entities_referenced": ["list", "of", "entity_ids", "used"],
    "relationships_used": ["list", "of", "predicates", "used"]
}
```

These prompts:
1. Enforce clear separation between entities and relationships
2. Provide explicit examples of the expected format
3. Maintain consistency in how relationships are represented
4. Make it clear that entity IDs are the bridge between structured_data and knowledge_graph

Would you like me to proceed with updating the memory manager implementation to use these prompts and enforce this structure?

---

_**User**_

That looks good, except that I do not think the query prompt used to handle user input needs to return anything other than the response and confidence. I am also not sure that confidence is needed since it seems not to be used and is not recorded in the conversation_history.

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, you're right on both counts. Let me simplify the Query Memory Prompt:

```text
You are a memory management system. Your task is to answer queries using the structured memory state.

Current Memory State:
{MEMORY_JSON}

Query:
{QUERY}

Requirements:
1. Use both structured_data and knowledge_graph to form complete answers
2. Reference entities by their names (not IDs) in your response
3. Use relationship information to explain connections
4. Maintain consistency with the stored information

Return ONLY a valid JSON object with this structure:
{
    "response": "Your natural language response to the query"
}
```

This is much cleaner and focuses on what's actually needed - just the response. The confidence score wasn't providing value, and tracking referenced entities/relationships would be unnecessary overhead.

Would you like me to proceed with updating the memory manager implementation to use these three prompts (Create, Update, and this simplified Query)?

---

_**User**_

Yes, please proceed with updating the memory manager implementation to use the three proposed prompts (Create, Update, and the simplified Query)

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll update the MemoryManager implementation to use these new prompts and enforce the cleaner data structure.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



I've updated the MemoryManager implementation with several key changes:

1. Removed the domain-specific configuration in favor of fixed, clear prompts
2. Updated the memory structure to enforce:
   - `structured_data.entities` for entity information
   - `knowledge_graph.relationships` for relationship triples
3. Added validation to ensure the correct structure is maintained
4. Simplified the query response to only include the response text
5. Made the update_memory method handle both regular updates and reflections
6. Streamlined the reflection process to use the same update mechanism

The key improvements are:
1. Clearer separation between entities and relationships
2. More consistent data structure
3. Better validation of LLM responses
4. Simpler, more focused prompts
5. Removal of unused confidence scores
6. More efficient reflection mechanism

Would you like me to make any adjustments to this implementation?

---

_**User**_

I think the chages are porbably an improvement, but I do not want to lose the domain_config. It will be needed to provide use-case-specfic instructions to the agent and to the memory manager. Remember, the goal is for the agent to support use cases ranging from running D&D Campaigns to helping with User Story Creation

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, you're absolutely right. The domain configuration is crucial for customizing the agent's behavior for different use cases. Let me modify the changes to keep the domain configuration while still implementing the improved memory structure.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



I've updated the MemoryManager to maintain domain configuration while keeping the improved memory structure. Key changes:

1. Restored domain configuration with a clearer structure:
   ```python
   {
       "schema": {
           "entity_types": {
               "generic": ["name", "description"],
               "location": ["name", "type", "description"],
               "character": ["name", "type", "description"]
           },
           "relationship_types": [
               "CONTAINS",
               "RELATED_TO",
               "INTERACTS_WITH"
           ]
       },
       "prompts": {
           "create_memory": "...",
           "query": "...",
           "update": "..."
       }
   }
   ```

2. Updated prompts to include domain schema:
   - Each prompt now receives the domain schema as context
   - LLM is instructed to follow domain-specific entity types and relationships
   - Added domain-specific conventions and terminology requirements

3. Maintained the improved memory structure:
   - Clear separation between entities and relationships
   - Consistent triple format for relationships
   - Required entity properties based on domain schema

This way we get the best of both worlds:
1. Clean, consistent memory structure
2. Domain-specific customization through configuration
3. LLM guidance based on domain requirements

Would you like me to make any adjustments to this implementation?

---

_**User**_

Great. Are any changes needed in agent_usage_example.py

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at `agent_usage_example.py`, it's already well-structured and compatible with our updated MemoryManager. The key parts that interact with the memory system are:

1. Service initialization with domain config:
```python
memory_manager = MemoryManager(
    llm_service, 
    "agent_memory.json",
    domain_config=DND_CONFIG
)
```

2. Memory state viewing/manipulation through helper functions:
```python
def print_memory_state(memory_manager, title="Current Memory State")
def print_conversation_history(memory_manager, title="Conversation History")
```

3. Campaign initialization that uses the memory system:
```python
campaign_data = """Please structure the following campaign information..."""
success = await agent.learn(campaign_data)
```

The only potential improvement would be to update the campaign initialization data to better match our new structured format. Let me modify that part:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



The changes I made:
1. Restructured the campaign data to clearly separate entities and their properties
2. Made it explicit that entities need IDs and should follow the domain schema
3. Added examples of relationship triples using the graph notation
4. Organized the data in a way that better matches our new memory structure

The rest of the file works well with our updated MemoryManager because:
1. It already handles domain configuration properly
2. The memory state printing functions work with any valid JSON structure
3. The interactive commands (memory, conversation, reflect) work with our updated format

Would you like me to make any other changes to the example?

---

_**User**_

We need to fix something based on the interaction transcript:



---

_**Assistant**_



Ah yes, I see the issue. The initialization is failing because the LLM's response isn't matching our required structure. Looking at the error:

```
Failed to parse direct JSON, attempting to extract JSON structure...
Missing 'entities' object in structured_data
```

We should make the required structure even more explicit in the campaign initialization data. Let me update it:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



The key changes I made:
1. Added a complete example of the exact JSON structure we expect
2. Showed concrete examples of entity IDs (valley_1, settlement_1)
3. Made the relationship format more explicit with a subject-predicate-object example
4. Emphasized that the response must match this structure EXACTLY

This should help the LLM generate a response that matches our required format and passes the validation checks in the MemoryManager. Would you like me to make any other changes?

---

_**User**_

Important to keep in mind: We do not want the agent or memory manager code to be sensitive to the details of the data structure inside structured_data and knowledge_graph. This data should never be directly inspected or updated by the code. Only the LLM should modify this data. The memory manager can make recommendations about it to the LLM. On the other hand, the convesation_history section of the memory is directly managed by the code.

This will allow the LLM fleibility to define the most appropriate data structure for the use case - with domain-specific config/suggestions during initialization.

---

_**Assistant**_



Ah yes, this is a crucial point about the architecture. Looking at our current implementation:

1. Good parts:
- The MemoryManager only validates the top-level structure (`structured_data`, `knowledge_graph`, `conversation_history`, `metadata`)
- The conversation_history is directly managed by the code
- The domain_config provides suggestions to the LLM but doesn't enforce a structure

2. Issue to fix:
- We're validating too deeply when we check for `"entities"` in `structured_data` and `"relationships"` in `knowledge_graph`

Let me modify the validation in MemoryManager to respect this separation of concerns:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Now we should also update the example in `agent_usage_example.py` to reflect this philosophy - the example structure should be presented as a suggestion rather than a requirement:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



These changes better reflect our architectural philosophy:
1. The code only cares about the top-level structure
2. The internal structure of `structured_data` and `knowledge_graph` is entirely up to the LLM
3. The domain configuration and examples serve as suggestions, not requirements
4. Only the conversation history is directly managed by the code

This gives the LLM the flexibility to organize the data in whatever way makes the most sense for each specific use case, while maintaining a clean separation between code-managed and LLM-managed sections of the memory.

---

_**User**_

If you look at the agent debug log, you will see that interaction responses do not have a consistent structure. There is not always a "response" property. So reponses are not getting incorporated into the conversation_history

---

_**Assistant**_



Ah yes, I see the issue in the debug log. The LLM responses vary in structure:

1. First response:
```json
{
"response": {
"world": "The Lost Valley is a mysterious region..."
}
}
```

2. Second response:
```json
{
  "quest": {
    "name": "Retrieve Ancient Artifact",
    "description": "Elena, the Mayor of Haven...",
    "reward": "100 gold pieces",
    "location": "The Lost Valley"
  }
}
```

We need to ensure consistent response structure. Let me update the query prompt in the MemoryManager and add response validation:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Now let's add validation for the response structure:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_







The changes:

1. Updated query prompt to be explicit about required response structure:
   - Must be a JSON object
   - Must have a single "response" property
   - The response value must be a string
   - Added a clear example

2. Added response validation:
   - Checks that result is a dictionary
   - Checks that it has a "response" property
   - Checks that the response value is a string
   - Returns error message if validation fails

This will ensure:
1. Consistent response structure for conversation history
2. Clear error messages if LLM doesn't follow the format
3. All responses are properly recorded in conversation history

Would you like me to make any other changes to improve response handling?

---

_**User**_

I restarted the exampe am seeing:



---

_**Assistant**_



I see the error in the initialization output:
```
Failed to parse direct JSON, attempting to extract JSON structure...
Error parsing extracted JSON structure: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 56 column 2 (char 794)
```

Looking at the debug log, the LLM's response is missing a closing brace `}` at the end. The response ends with:
```json
"events": {}
}
```
but needs:
```json
"events": {}
}
}
```

Let's improve the JSON parsing in the MemoryManager to handle this case:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_







The changes:
1. Extract the JSON string from the response
2. Count opening and closing braces
3. If there are more opening braces than closing braces, add the missing closing braces
4. Then attempt to parse the fixed JSON string

This should handle cases where the LLM's response is missing closing braces. The approach is safe because:
1. We only add closing braces if there are more opening braces
2. We maintain the original structure of the JSON
3. We log when we fix the structure

Would you like me to make any other improvements to the error handling?

---

_**User**_

There is a problem. Clearly the interaction prompt is confusing the LLM so that it is returnin a complex object instead of { "response": "" }

---

_**Assistant**_



Ah yes, I see the issue. The LLM is getting confused because we're showing it the schema in the query prompt, which makes it think it should return data in that format. Let's simplify the query prompt to be very explicit about returning ONLY a response string:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_







I've simplified the query prompt to:
1. Remove the schema (not needed for generating responses)
2. Make the response format requirement more explicit
3. Add clear warnings about what NOT to do
4. Focus solely on generating a natural language response string

The key changes:
1. Removed all the requirements about how to use the memory data
2. Added explicit warnings about not returning complex objects
3. Made the example response format simpler
4. Added emphasis on returning ONLY the response object

This should help the LLM understand that it should:
1. Read the memory state
2. Form its response as a natural language string
3. Return ONLY the `{"response": "string"}` structure

Would you like me to make any other changes to ensure consistent response formatting?

---

_**User**_

It looks like the interaction prompt still includes the complex schema and not the simple response schema. It looks like the domain cofigs are not updated and are overriding the defult prompts.

I don't think the domain configs should provide prompts and schemas. Instead they should provide text instructions/suggestions and these should only be used when initializing the memory.

---

_**Assistant**_



Ah yes, you're right! The domain config should only provide guidance for the initial memory structure, not override the core prompts. Let me update this:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_







Now let's update the query and update prompts to be simple and consistent:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_







Now let's update the methods to use these prompts:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_







The changes:

1. Removed prompts from domain config, replaced with domain_instructions
2. Made core prompts class constants that don't change with domain
3. Simplified the prompts:
   - Query prompt only returns `{"response": "string"}`
   - Update prompt maintains memory structure but is less prescriptive
4. Domain config now only provides suggestions for initial memory structure
5. Removed schema references from query and update operations

This approach:
1. Keeps domain-specific guidance where it belongs (initialization)
2. Makes response format consistent and simple
3. Lets the LLM organize the memory structure as needed
4. Maintains clean separation between code and LLM responsibilities

Would you like me to make any other changes to improve this separation of concerns?

---

_**User**_

Looks like a template error?



---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, there's a template error in the QUERY_PROMPT. The issue is with the JSON example in the prompt - it's being interpreted as a Python format string placeholder because of the curly braces.

Let me fix that by escaping the curly braces in the example:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



In Python string formatting:
- Single curly braces `{}` are treated as placeholders
- Double curly braces `{{}}` are escaped and appear as single curly braces in the output

This should fix the template error and allow the query to work properly. Would you like me to make any other changes?

---

_**User**_

It seems that the reflect phase is not clearing the conversation_history and it is also not updating the memory. There are no errors, though.

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the code and the issue you described, I see a few problems in the reflection and update logic:

1. In `update_memory`, we're storing the existing history but never restoring it properly
2. The reflection operation isn't properly updating the memory structure
3. The conversation history clearing isn't happening at the right point

Let me fix these issues:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



The key changes I made:

1. Fixed the reflection process:
   - Added a dedicated reflection prompt that instructs the LLM to analyze conversations and update memory
   - Made reflection a direct operation instead of recursively calling update_memory
   - Added proper error handling and validation

2. Improved conversation history management:
   - Properly preserve and restore conversation history during updates
   - Only clear the specific messages that were processed during reflection
   - Use list comprehension to filter out processed messages

3. Removed unnecessary message handling:
   - Removed special handling of system messages
   - Simplified the update_memory flow

4. Added better logging:
   - More descriptive print statements
   - Clear indication of reflection progress and results

These changes should ensure that:
1. Reflection properly updates the memory structure
2. Only processed messages are cleared from history
3. Memory updates preserve conversation history
4. The reflection process is more robust and transparent

Would you like me to make any other changes to improve the reflection process?

---

_**User**_

Seeing:



---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the error log and the code, I see the issue. The reflection is failing because the LLM's response isn't properly formatted as JSON. Let's improve the reflection prompt to be more explicit about the required JSON format and add better error handling:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



The changes I made:

1. Made the reflection prompt more explicit about the required JSON structure:
   - Added a clear example of the expected format
   - Added explicit warnings about not including extra text or markdown
   - Emphasized that only the JSON object should be returned

2. Improved JSON parsing with better error handling:
   - First tries direct JSON parsing
   - If that fails, attempts to extract JSON-like structure using regex
   - Fixes common issues like missing closing braces
   - Provides better error messages for debugging

3. Simplified the docstring to remove redundant information

These changes should help ensure that:
1. The LLM returns properly formatted JSON
2. Even if the response isn't perfect, we can still extract and fix the JSON structure
3. We get better error messages to understand what went wrong

Would you like me to make any other improvements to the reflection process?

---

_**User**_

I see a problem with the reflect prompt. The instructions are:

The instructions should be: preserve the existing structured_data and Knoweldge_graph data and augment it with data from the conversation_history section

Then, the conversation history, which is already in the context, is included again. This may be why the result does NOT include the rich data that was in the context. It is lost.

If we get the reflect prompt right, the system will start working as expected. This is the key!

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, you've identified the core issue! The reflection prompt needs to be clearer about preserving and augmenting the existing data, and we're redundantly including the conversation history. Let me fix this:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



Key changes made:

1. Removed redundant conversation history passing since it's already in the memory state
2. Made preservation of existing data much more explicit:
   - Added clear instruction to PRESERVE all existing data
   - Emphasized that we're ADDING to existing data, not replacing it
   - Made it clear that only contradicted information should be updated

3. Updated the requirements to emphasize preservation:
   - "Keep ALL existing entities and relationships"
   - "Add new entities and relationships discovered"
   - "Only update if clearly contradicted"
   - "Ensure all existing IDs remain consistent"

4. Changed the JSON structure comments to emphasize addition:
   - "ALL existing entities PLUS any new ones"
   - "ALL existing relationships PLUS any new ones"

This should help ensure that the LLM:
1. Keeps all existing structured data and relationships
2. Only adds new information from conversations
3. Preserves the rich context we've built up

Would you like me to make any other adjustments to the reflection prompt?

---

_**User**_

The reflect prompt is still not preserving the data and it is also changing the schema unnecessarily. Is there a way to dynamicall extract the schema of the memory's structure_data and knowledge_graph sections and explicitly ask fo that schema?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, that's a great idea! We can analyze the current memory structure and include its schema in the reflection prompt. Let me modify the `_perform_reflection` method to do this:

---

_**Assistant**_



---

_**Assistant**_



The changes:

1. Added `_extract_schema` method to analyze the structure of the current memory:
   - Recursively extracts the schema of nested dictionaries and lists
   - Preserves the exact structure and field names
   - Records types of primitive values

2. Updated reflection prompt to be more explicit about schema:
   - Shows the exact schema that must be maintained
   - Includes real examples of current entities and relationships
   - Emphasizes that the structure must not change

3. Made the instructions more specific:
   - "maintain the EXACT same schema structure"
   - "DO NOT change the structure or format"
   - Shows examples of both entity and relationship formats

This should help ensure that:
1. The LLM maintains the exact same data structure
2. New information follows the existing schema
3. Existing data is preserved
4. The memory structure remains consistent

Would you like me to make any adjustments to the schema extraction or prompt format?

---

_**User**_

Let's make a couple of changes to the reflect prompt:

1) Only include the structured_data and knowledge_graph in the Current Memory State
2) Make it clear that the conversation history is not part of the memory that the LLM manages.
3) Ask the LLM to process the conversation history - provided separately in th eprompt instructions - and add any relevant data to the structure_data and knowledge_graph

Yes, let's modify the reflection prompt to make these distinctions clear and ensure the LLM understands its role in managing only the core memory structures:

Key changes made:

1. Created `core_memory` that only includes `structured_data` and `knowledge_graph`
2. Restructured the prompt to clearly separate:
   - Current core memory state (without conversation history)
   - Recent conversations to process (provided separately)
   - Schema requirements

3. Made the LLM's task more explicit:
   - Analyze conversations for new information
   - Add information to core structures
   - Maintain schema consistency

4. Added explicit rule about not including conversation_history or metadata

5. Fixed entity example extraction to work with the array structure in `structured_data.entities`

The prompt now clearly separates the LLM's responsibilities:
- What to analyze (conversations)
- What to update (core memory structures)
- What to preserve (existing data and schema)
- What not to include (conversation history and metadata)

Would you like me to make any adjustments to these changes?
