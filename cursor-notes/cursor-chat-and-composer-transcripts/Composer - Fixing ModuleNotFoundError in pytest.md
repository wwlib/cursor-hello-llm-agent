## Fixing ModuleNotFoundError in pytest (12/27/2024, 7:32:43 AM)

pytest is returning an error that `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'`

Can you fix the paths, etc.

_**Assistant**_

This error occurs because Python can't find the `src` module in its path. Let me help you set up the project structure correctly.

First, I'll check if we have a proper Python package structure.

To fix the module import issue, we need to:
1. Create a `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` to make the package installable
2. Install the package in development mode

I'll create a `pyproject.toml` file:

Now, let me check your current requirements.txt:

Now I'll update the requirements.txt to include development dependencies:

Now you'll need to reinstall the requirements. I'll run the command for you:

Still getting the same error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'`

_**Assistant**_

Let me try a different approach. We need to make sure Python can find the `src` package when running tests. Let's create a `conftest.py` file in the root directory to modify the Python path:

Also, let's make sure the `src` directory is properly set up as a Python package by adding an `__init__.py` file:

Let's also add `__init__.py` files to the memory module:

Now try running the tests again. The error should be resolved. If you're still seeing the error, try running pytest with the `-v` flag to get more detailed output:
